You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention. And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out. And the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America?

It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.', 'And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.', ""I am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment."", 'Now, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.', ""We've got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?"", 'Now, as I said it the other night – how many of you saw the debate?', 'Well as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about – well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it – not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great – but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.', ""My opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.' He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don't see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here's what he said. He said, 'I alone can fix it.' I alone?"", ""Well, we have learned that that's his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that's not how change happens in America. It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful – all of us.""]","

Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.', ""How many of you – just think back over your lives – how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It's one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country."", 'This has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.', 'People are starting to call out their services!', ""There is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back."", ""We've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.' Isn't that great? I think we should make that a national slogan."", ""Now we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs – all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I'm really grateful to them."", 'We also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.', ""Maybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world."", ""And you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.""]","

Hillary Clinton,Speech71_20:30,"[""It's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life."", ""I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.'"", ""But sometimes it's hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that's not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute."", ""So what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America."", ""I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people."", ""Way back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?' And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here's what I plan to do."", ""First, let's triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It's finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so."", ""Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it. So let's lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to."", ""Now second, let's grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We've got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program."", ""Third, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.""]","

Hillary Clinton,Speech71_30:42,"[""Now I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn't something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community."", ""And finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves – right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let's do something like that in the civilian space. Let's call it the National Service Reserve."", ""And here's the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community."", ""And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won't have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably. We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership."", ""I also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities."", ""Now, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps – but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go. Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I'll do that, but – I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart – and this is one of them."", 'Thank you!', ""For me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.' Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own."", ""That's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan. It's a course of action. So here's what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together – to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people."", ""There are so many examples in this community and communities across America – 39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are."", 'Thank you and God bless you!""', '']","

I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That\'s the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.', ""Audience Member: We're proud of you!"", ""Clinton: Thank you. Thank you. And I think her – I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed."", ""Now, I have to thank – I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that's what I intend to do."", ""Now, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched – I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt."", ""Now, there's a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. 'I Will Vote.' Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered."", ""And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it's hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted. You're not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody."", ""The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that."", ""Now, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote.""]","

Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We're seeing spikes in early voting. And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote."", ""Now, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent."", ""Now, last night I got a chance – I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren."", ""And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund. It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential."", ""And during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people."", ""We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other."", ""When my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?' And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in."", ""And then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early – it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.' And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school."", ""So when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure – we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from."", ""As I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just – it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens – if you've ever seen one – and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.""]","

Hillary Clinton,Speech77_20:30,"[""So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because – when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I've talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I'll be at a café or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me – it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts."", ""So I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and – and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because – number one, it's fair. It's fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?"", 'And the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.', 'And last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.', ""Now, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people – dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers – across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It's heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business."", ""And in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It's really hard out there, isn't it? And just listening to Christine's story – getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job – that's not an uncommon story. We've made it really hard for a lot of people."", ""So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget."", ""Now, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want – I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner."", ""Now, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again – not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn't worked out so well. We've got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful."", ""So I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trump's claims. There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.""]","

Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father – his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard."", ""So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part."", ""The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question."", ""And he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, 'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I'll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.'"", ""So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying."", 'But words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, ""Hey, we\'re not sure we\'re going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty."" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America\'s word, America\'s intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, \'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.\'', ""This is not reality TV. This is real. It's as real as it gets. so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected."", ""And we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them."", ""So there's work to do. But it's great work. It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election's going to be close. They all are these days. That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina.

And remember, it's not just the presidential race. It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We're not fearful. We don't want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don't want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country."", ""I've got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That's what I'm offering. We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us."", 'That is exactly right. I love this country.

So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers. It was a case of blind haste to get out, and to call the tragic consequences somebody else's problem. Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous."", 'All of that is in the past; it cannot be undone. Another terrible miscalculation, unfolding right now, is a different story. That would be the Obama-Clinton-Kerry policy of treating the mullahs in Iran as a stabilizing force in the region when in fact they are deceitful dictators causing nothing but instability.', ""Whenever bad things happen in the Middle East, from Israel's borders to the shores of Yemen, the influence of the mullahs is rarely far from the scene. Here is a regime that supports terrorism, threatens to destroy Israel, has for years been trying to develop nuclear weapons, routinely commits human rights violations, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq, and even now is unlawfully detaining American citizens."", ""Iran, its ally Assad, its terrorist proxy Hizballah, and the sectarian militias it sponsors have fueled the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, that have helped give rise to ISIS. Yet the president's deal with Iran confronts none of these problems. And least of all does it prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. In fact the deal prepares the way for that capability. With the lifting of sanctions, the deal also frees up more than 100 billion dollars for Iran's security services to use as they wish. In effect, the primary investors in a violent, radical Middle East have just received a new round of funding, courtesy of the United States and the United Nations.""]","

Jeb Bush,Speech265_20:30,"[""And, this is President Obama's idea of a diplomatic triumph. It is a deal unwise in the extreme, with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme. It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America."", 'If the Congress does not reject this deal, then the damage must be undone by the next president — and it will be my intention to begin that process immediately. Knowing what has gone wrong, however, is not the same as knowing how to set it right.', 'The threat of global jihad, and of the Islamic State in particular, requires all the strength, unity, and confidence that only American leadership can provide. Radical Islam is a threat we are entirely capable of overcoming, and I will be unyielding in that cause should I be elected President of the United States. We should pursue the clear and unequivocal objective of throwing back the barbarians of ISIS, and helping the millions in the region who want to live in peace. Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make, we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive, to keep it, and to prevail.', 'In all of this, the United States must engage with friends and allies, and lead again in that vital region. Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the most populous Arab country and the wealthiest, are important partners of the United States. Those relationships have been badly mishandled by this administration. Both countries are key to a better-coordinated regional effort against terrorism. We need to restore trust, and work more closely with them against common threats. We have very capable partners, likewise, in the United Arab Emirates, who are willing and able to take the fight to the extremists. We have a moderate and quite formidable leader in King Abdullah of Jordan. We have an ally in the new democratic government in Tunisia, and a fragile democracy in Lebanon — nations that are both under assault by radicals and terrorists. Across the region, responsible governments need no persuading of what the moment requires.', ""It requires action, coordination, and American leadership to bring it all together. My strategy meets the unique circumstances in each of the two countries, Iraq and Syria, in which ISIS now has territory. And let's start with Iraq, and the five broad actions I would take as president to help remove the threat from that country."", 'First, we must support the Iraqi forces, which right now have the will to win, but not the means. As matters stand, the United States has been helping to reconstitute Iraqi security services and to aid the Kurdish peshmerga. We need to broaden and expedite our efforts to help ensure Iraqis rebuild their security sector — not only to win against ISIS, but to break free of Iranian influence. And that effort should also involve even greater engagement with the Sunni tribes, whose fighting units served side-by-side with Americans to defeat al-Qaeda-in-Iraq and were then disbanded by the Maliki government.', ""Second, we must give these forces the consistent advantage of American air power, to cover their operations and to strike with fierce precision. The strategy has to include forward air controllers, whose skill and accuracy would severely hinder the enemy's freedom of movement. This would greatly improve the ability of fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to provide necessary close air support to local ground forces. ISIS fighters try blending into the civilian landscape. Our spotters on the ground will enable us to hit them hard and rarely miss."", 'Third, we must make better use of the limited forces we have by giving them a greater range of action. Right now, we have around 3,500 soldiers and marines in Iraq, and more may well be needed. We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces. But we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country. Our unrivaled warfighters know that it is simply not enough to dispense advice and training to local forces, then send them on their way and hope for the best. Canadian troops are already embedded in Iraqi units to very good effect. Our soldiers and marines need the go-ahead to do that as well, to help our partners outthink and outmaneuver the enemy.', ""Fourth, we should providemore support to the Kurds, giving them decisive military power against ISIS. In Iraq's Kurdish region, we have loyal friends and brave and skilled fighters. If I am commander in chief, the United States will make certain that the Kurds have everything they need to win."", ""And finally, our strategy in Iraq has to restart the serious diplomatic efforts that can help that country move in the right direction. Only Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds can decide if they will live together and share power and resources in a way that will serve their interests, assuring the survival of their country. But these partners have to know that while the United States is there in measure, we are also there in earnest and for the long haul. They will come through for their country, but they've got to be certain that we have their back.""]","

Jeb Bush,Speech265_30:50,"[""Now, the situation in Syria is quite different from the one in Iraq. In some ways, it is even more complex because we have no large, cohesive force to work with. And here, too, we have seen what ruin and suffering can follow when America doesn't lead."", ""Of 23 million Syrians, about 11 million have been displaced or fled the country altogether. More than two hundred thousand people have so far been killed in the mayhem. The regime of Bashar al-Assad is deploying every ruthless means to stay in power. Long brutalized by that regime, now under assault from ISIS, Syrian moderates want to fight against both enemies, and they view the regime as the greater evil. It's a sorrowful picture when you think back on how it could have been avoided."", ""Exactly four years ago, we heard words that still hang in the air of the Middle East — when President Obama declared that 'the time has come for President Assad to step aside.' Then, three years ago, came another pronouncement — that any use of chemical weapons by Assad would be a 'red line,' inviting tough consequences for the regime."", 'If the choice was between silence and these idle, grandiose words, it would have been better to say nothing at all. What followed is that Assad used those weapons, again and again, and there were no serious consequences whatsoever. Having lost our credibility on such an epic scale, it is hard to get it back. But we had better try, because the longer we do nothing, the more dangerous the situation becomes, and the more directly our friends and our interests are threatened.', 'Our ultimate goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS and to achieve long-term political stability in that country. Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse. The last thing we need in Syria is a repeat of Libya, with its plan-less aftermath, where the end of a dictatorship was only the beginning of more terrorist violence, including the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Syria will need a stable government, and a transition free of more sectarian blood-letting will depend on the credible moderate forces we help unite and build up today. To that end, my strategy would bring American influence to bear in four all-important areas of action.', ""First, a coordinated, international effort is essential to give Syria's moderate forces the upper hand. As it is, the Qataris, the Turks, the Saudis, and others have been supporting fighting groups in Syria. But these groups are not always working to common purpose. And if there's anything that moderate forces in Syria cannot afford right now it's confusion and disunity."", ""Under my strategy, the aim would be to draw the moderates together and back them up, as one force. And we should back that force up all the way through — not just in taking the fight to the enemy, but in helping them to form a stable, moderate government once ISIS is defeated and Assad is gone. It's a tough, complicated diplomatic and military proposition, even more so than the current situation in Iraq. But it can be done. We saw in the Iraq surge how Islamic moderates can be pulled away from extremist forces. And the strategic elements in both cases are the same — we have to support local forces, and we must stay true to our word."", ""Second, we have to expand and vastly improve the recruitment and training of Syrian forces fighting ISIS. At the moment, too many in Syria doubt that they can count on us, which explains why our recruiting and training have basically come to nothing. When a five hundred million dollar program gets you 54 recruits, you know the plan's not working out. The reality is, our recruitment efforts have been failing in Syria because we are not respected anymore as a reliable actor in the region. And we have to change that impression with the kind of clear, consistent, and credible action that every nation should expect from the United States of America."", ""Third, we must over time establish multiple safe zones in Syria. It's a measure of progress that we have joined with the Turks to create a small, 'ISIS-free zone' in the northern part of the country. But we need to go beyond well this, by establishing safe zones to protect Syrians not only from ISIS, but also from Assad."", ""Fourth, we and our partners should declare a no-fly zone in Syria, and then work to expand that zone to prevent more crimes by the regime. Enforce that no-fly zone, and we'll stop the regime's bombing raids that kill helpless civilians. It could also keep Iranian flights from resupplying the regime, Hizballah, and other bad actors. A no-fly zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad, counter Iranian influence, keep the pressure on for a settlement, and prevent more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it."", 'When we talk about no-fly zones in Syria, precision airstrikes in Iraq, or any projection of military power to meet or deter threats, all of this assumes that such power is there when we need it. Yet here as well, the shortsightedness of the present administration will leave a cost. We are in the seventh year of a significant dismantling of our own military, in almost inverse proportion to the threats that are multiplying. And I assure you: the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America.', 'A winning strategy against the Islamic State, or against any threat to ourselves and our friends, depends ultimately on the military strength that underwrites American influence. Let that slip away, and what would America be in world affairs, except one more well-intentioned voice at the United Nations? In any effort of ours to overcome violence and secure peace, a winning strategy depends on maintaining unequaled strength, and we can never take it for granted.', 'I might add that this includes strength among our intelligence services, military and civilian. No men and women receive so little credit for doing so much to track dangers and keep us safe. These skilled and brave Americans can be sure of this: If I become commander in chief, they will receive the tools they need and the gratitude, respect, and support they deserve.', 'A good many people who serve in our military and intelligence agencies are at mid-career. And I venture to guess that for quite a few of them, their calling has something to do with their coming of age in the Reagan years. Yet any nostalgia for that time has to recall, not only a falling wall and collapsing evil empire, but also the fear, and tension, and dead-serious challenges that could all have played out so very differently. From the distance of decades, even the greatest successes in security and foreign policy can look almost inevitable. Of course, nothing had to happen as it did. Weariness with conflict ran pretty deep back then, along with despair of ever getting past it. But then along came, one formidable figure, who would not accept that way of thinking, and he was the one who mattered the most.', ""It's that way for us too, in having to deal with long conflicts and serious threats that are again on the offensive. And in living up to our responsibilities, we can always use a little more of the Reagan spirit — rejecting with contempt the idea that conflict must be endless, or that the spread of danger and violence is inevitable. It is not."", 'For generations, American-led alliances, American diplomacy, and American credibility deterred aggression and defended the peace. This is the way forward in our time as well, led by a president who is resolute — as I will be — in the defeat of radical Islamic terrorism wherever it appears.', ""We can protect our people, put adversaries back in retreat, get things moving our way again, and win back the momentum for freedom's cause. In all of this, let us never forget that in fighting evil, we are doing good; in stopping the merciless, we are delivering justice; and in destroying the violent, we are defending the innocent."", 'This is the work that America is in this world to do.

And I am thrilled to see the progress – she talked about some of the barriers that she faced when she came here to go to college, and how a lot of those barriers have been broken down and eliminated. What she didn't say is that in addition to the leadership Tom Harkin showed in getting the ADA passed, Jan was a strong voice in favor of that as well and an incredible witness for what it would mean."", 'I think that we should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country. I remember my first job out of law school was with the Children\'s Defense Fund. I didn\'t want to go work for a law firm. I wanted to go to work to be an advocate, and I joined the organization started by Marian Wright Edelman, an incredible woman lawyer, African-American, first ever to pass – and be acknowledged as passing – the Mississippi state bar, and Marian started the Children\'s Defense Fund. When I joined, our first project in the summer of 1973 was to go door to door along with others across our country to gather evidence about why so many American children were not in school. We suspected that one of the biggest reasons was that their disabilities were not accommodated in school, and therefore they could not attend school. But we didn\'t know that for sure, and we wanted to find out. So I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, saying, ""Do you have a school-aged child who\'s not in school?"" And I heard, yes, you know, our daughter dropped out to take care of the younger kids, or our son dropped out to go to work to help support the family. But I heard mostly that, yes, we have a blind child, a deaf child, a child in a wheelchair, a child with some other kind of disability that is not accepted in school. So we gathered up all of our evidence, and we presented it to the Congress, and that first effort resulted in passing Education for All, and all children with disabilities were given the right to go to school. That was a huge step forward for our country.', 'And then the effort began with real conviction to try to expand the rights that people with disabilities should have in our society. Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Tony Coelho, and then the bill was finally passed and signed by George H.W. Bush. It was a great success in showing that bipartisanship – bringing people together to solve a problem that affected millions of our fellow citizens – could actually work.', ""We've come a long way in the last 25 years. We still have work to do. We're by no means finished. And when I was Secretary of State, President Obama and I wanted to get passed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We held an event at the White House. We lined up sponsors, both in the Congress and outside, because it required the Congress – the Senate – to pass. And then we worked really hard, and the Republicans would not support it in the numbers needed. They wouldn't even listen to the pleas of their former leader, Senator Robert Dole, who as you know lost the use of an arm when he was in the military in World War II."", ""So there's a lot of unfinished business – both at home, and around the world. But I personally believe that the progress and the landmark legislation – first on education then broadly opening up transportation and buildings and employment, everything that people should be able to pursue – that that legislation was one of the real highlights of the civil rights and human rights movements in America."", ""We have our faults and we have our challenges, but there isn't any nation that has continually tried to push forward to widen the circle of opportunity the way we have. Despite the continuing problems that we face, we're going to keep doing that."", ""So I want to applaud you, Jan, and others who have been at the forefront of this movement. I want to introduce the Todds – Dale, Sara and Adam – who are here. I've turned over my twitter account to Sara to be tweeting about the challenges they face as a family with a young man who's got some challenges himself because I think we all have to recognize that as much progress as we've made, we still have work to do.

And if we don't have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better."", ""We've come back from really tough economic times. The great recession just really knocked people to the ground. People lost their jobs, they lost their homes they postponed doing things like going to college, they had to keep working if they had a job even if they were at or beyond retirement. It really took a lot out of everybody. And we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds. They took extra jobs like some of you they skipped what were really necessities but they figured out how to make them not as urgent a need, like not driving the car as much or not buying all the food that the family required. So everybody made it work."", ""But the deck is still stacked for those at the top.

Now I happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families."", 'And I\'m running for President because I think everyday Americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything I can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about. I want you to get ahead and stay ahead. I want to make the words ""middle class"" mean something again.', ""Now, when we think about strong families being the backbone of our country, we have to recognize that our economy is different and our families are different. I was born in Chicago and the families of today are not exactly the same as the family I was born into. Most families need two incomes or two jobs if there is only one parent to make ends meet. And 40 percent of moms, just like LaKeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household. So that's a big different from the way it was when I and others here were growing up. Yet we haven't adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account. You know I can remember very well when I was a young lawyer before I had my daughter in my law firm where I worked in Arkansas, around 3 o'clock I'd see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and I didn't know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home. And it wasn't accepted back then that you could be a good worker and a devoted parent at the same time, especially for women. But that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love."", ""So we know that with Moms and Dads squeezing every minute out of a 24-hour day and with you Mary Carmen saying you work 17 hours, it's hard to even find time to breathe. And many can't count on anybody being there to help you because everyone you know is working hard and trying to make ends meet."", ""So finding high quality, affordable, flexible childcare is more important than ever. But it's also harder than ever."", ""Federal and state funding for childcare has not kept up with changing times and rising demand. So it's no surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent over the past decade. And now the Republican budget that is being worked on by the Congress would cut funding even more. Making it so much more difficult. America cannot turn its back on our children and our working parents. Family values are economic values. I'm going to be putting forth plans to fix this. We should do it now.

I'll look for responsible ways to go even further, whether it's providing tax cuts to new parents or grants to states targeted for infants and toddlers.

And you know its embarrassing, I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, there are only 9 countries left in the world that have no form of paid family leave, and we are one of them. And the other ones are tiny countries, countries without many resources. Every other country has something that says, we think it's really important that moms bond with their newborn babies, we think its important that a dad can have some time, we think it's important that children can take care of their parents as those parents maybe are ill or failing.

And many of you know how hard that is because you have two people helping you take care of 16 children. There are a lot of places where there would be one person trying to take care of 16 children. We have to reducing overcrowding and increasing training and most importantly we have to increase wages. Because you expect to make a living doing the most important job in the world if you have to sacrifice your own family. That doesn't make any sense to me at all."", 'So to all the childcare workers here today, I want you to know that the service and care you provide strengthens our economy, it strengthens families and helps prepare children. You should be valued for that, respected for that, and you should be paid for that.', ""Now I am a new Grandmother and it's really wonderful but just being around my new 7 1/2 month old granddaughter just reinforces what I believe, which is when when we short-change childcare workers, we short-change kids and short-change Americans' future. It makes it harder to retain the best staff. It makes it harder to keep up those high standards."", 'So we have to stand firmly together and united on behalf of your right to organize, your right to bargain collectively, your right to fighting together for the higher wages that reflect the value of your work. There is nothing more important to the family or to the support of the family, which you are, than caring for our youngest children.', ""That's why I so respect the vital work that SEIU is doing, under the leadership of President Mary Kay Henry, is so vital. I think it is absolutely essential."", ""And I want to say something else about it, when people talk to me about the need to improve our educations system, I agree, because I want every child to have the best possible education. But education starts at birth. Education starts when that little baby comes into the world. In fact we now know, because of brain research, that about 80% of the brain is actually developed by the age of 3 and 4. If we don't take care of our babies we are short changing them on their brain development and then when we get to kindergarten no matter how hard they try, no matter how much their mom says do your best, do your homework, no matter how hard their teacher works they're going to be at a disadvantage. That's wrong, it isn't right that a child like my grandchild will have all of these opportunities because we're reading and we're talking and we're singing but we're not working 17 hour days and we're not trying to get by on $5100 after the expenses are paid. So yea, we're going to make sure that Charlotte has every chance in the world but I want every baby, everyone your babies and every baby you take care of to have exactly the same chances."", ""Ultimately, this is, for me, about how we work together to give every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. You see it in their faces when they are put in your arms from the very first minute. You want to keep that light in their eyes, you want to make sure they have every opportunity to fulfill that God-given potential. And I'm here because I want to help you and the parents you serve unlock that potential, when we unlock the full potential of every American, we can unlock the full potential and prosperity of America."", ""So for me, this is as important an as anything else that I'm going to talk about in my campaign for president.

So we're glad they're there."", ""And Shaun Donovan is one of your own, used to hang out around here a little bit.

They had a sense of how unstable their situations—how precarious their situations could be. But partly because we've seen a two-decade- to three-decade-long trend where increases in profitability, expansions of markets, increases in corporate profits, rises in the stock market don't translate into higher incomes and higher wages for the ordinary person, at the same time that their costs for sending their kids to college have skyrocketed.

That's what led me to get in this race in the first place, the sense that folks who were working hard were treading water, that we were becoming a country where just a few did well and so many others were struggling to get by. Problems like health care that had been escalating for decades, a lack of an energy policy that had put us in a vulnerable position every time there was turmoil in the Middle East, issues that had been lingering, but we kept on kicking down the road because we didn't have enough political will and political courage to do something about it.""]","

And already we've got 2.6 million young people who have coverage who did not have it before because of this law, seniors all across the country benefiting from lower prescription drug plan, and the promise not only of making sure health care is affordable and preventive care and mammograms and other things are available and people aren't being dropped from their health insurance when they get sick because they now have the Patient's Bill of Rights, but it also promises to actually, over time, lower health care costs, which will help reduce our deficits and help businesses and families well into the future."", ""We kept on focusing on energy, even though we were grappling with this economic crisis, and have doubled the production of clean energy in this country from wind and solar and biodiesel.

We did this at a time when changes around the world were taking place more quickly than we've ever seen before. And so even as I was managing two wars, we also had to deal with an Arab Spring in which suddenly millions of people, especially young people, said, we want a different way of life."", ""And there have been setbacks. There have been times where progress was not as fast as we wanted. And there's so much more work that remains to be done. We still have a broken immigration system that has to be reformed so that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We still have more work to do on energy, because the fact of the matter is that, for example, if America simply matched the energy efficiency of a country like Japan, we would lower our overall energy utilization by 20 or 25 percent.

They were big in 2008. I actually think they're bigger now."", ""Because in 2008, we recognized that there were a series of issues that had been building up over decades and that nobody had taken on. We hadn't gotten a smart energy policy. We hadn't been dealing with an education system that was inadequate. Our health care system was broken. Most importantly, middle class families were seeing their wages and their incomes flatline even though the costs of everything were going up. And the society was becoming more unequal, and the paths for middle class families to either stay in the middle class or get into the middle class were becoming blocked."", ""And what we've done over the last 2½ years has been to lay the foundation to take on those issues, first and foremost by making sure that we didn't plunge into a second Great Depression, making sure that the auto industry didn't collapse, making certain that the financial system didn't melt down. We passed health care reform, something I'm incredibly proud of, to lay the foundation for starting to reduce costs and increase affordability for families all across the country.

They think we should roll back regulations and let Wall Street do whatever it wants. We thought that one of the problems that we were facing in health care was that we have 30 million people uninsured. They're now running on the idea of making sure that 30 million people don't have health insurance."", ""And because people are scared and anxious about the future, how this election shakes out is going to help determine the course of this country for a very long time.

This country is being tested, but I have complete faith in its character. That's what this election is about. It's about values. It's about character. It's about who we are."", ""And if you're willing to fight with me for that, then I'm confident we're going to come out on the other side doing just fine."", 'Thank you.', '']","

[Laughter] So somebody else is going to have to manage things while she's gone."", 'Thank you so much, Sheryl and David and the kids, for opening up this beautiful home. Thank you all for being here tonight.', ""I don't want to spend too much time just in monologue. I want to--I know that one of the hallmarks of Silicon Valley and the Internet is that it's a two-way thing, it's not just one way. So I want to make sure that we have a good conversation. But let me just say a couple of things off the top."", ""First of all, many of you have been involved in my campaign dating back to 2008. Some of you I'm meeting for the first time. But all of you have a commitment to a particular vision of what America should be. Everybody here believes that the reason America is so special is because everybody can make it if they try; at least that's the ideal that we cling to. We all believe that education has to be not just the province of a few, but a gift for the many, because that's not only good for our kids, but that's good for our economic future. We're all committed to innovation and science and a belief that if you unleash the skills and the talents of people, that it's possible for us to create an economy that is doing well, but where prosperity is also broadly shared. We all believe in an America where it shouldn't matter where you come from or what you look like or who you love, but rather do you have values and gifts and talents that you're sharing with other Americans as citizens."", 'And those values are going to be tested in this election: the values of shared prosperity, being good stewards of the environment, making sure that we are investing in our kids, making sure that everybody has a shot. Those values are going to be tested. And so if 2008 was an important election, let me tell you, 2012 is an even more important election, because of all the reasons that Sheryl noted.', ""The American people are going through a very tough time. This is a big transition, and by the way, it's not unique to America. This is a global shift that's taking place. We've got a world that has shrunk and is interconnected and is more competitive than ever. And every country out there is trying to adjust and trying to figure out, how do we make sure we've got the best educated citizens, and how do we make sure we've got the most dynamic, innovative economy, and how are we making sure that we're investing in industries of the future like clean energy, and how do we make certain that in our international affairs we're projecting power not just based on our military, but also based on our diplomacy and the power of our ideas."", ""And those changes that are taking place are scary. And given that we've just gone through the worst financial crisis in our lifetimes--I'm looking around the room, and I don't think too many folks were around back in the 1930s. Just a guess. [Laughter] Given that so many Americans are still out there hurting each and every day, and although we've been able to stabilize the economy from what could have been a worse catastrophe--we've got 9-percent unemployment. And I get letters every single day from folks who are losing their homes and seeing their businesses shut down, not being able to work enough hours to pay the bills at the end of the month, or having to defer their retirement in order to make sure their kids go to college."", ""Given all the stresses and strains that ordinary folks are feeling and given the fact that some of the challenges we faced had been building up even before this financial crisis hit--and so the imperatives of having an energy policy that actually works for America and frees ourselves from dependence on foreign oil and improves our economy and makes sure that our planet doesn't reach a tipping point in terms of climate change; a health care system that is still hugely inefficient; an education system that's not educating enough of our kids; underinvestment in infrastructure and basic research--those challenges, those existed even before this crisis."", ""Given all that's happening, if we don't make good decisions now, then we may be making a set of decisions that have dire consequences for not just this generation, but for many generations to come. Most of the people under this tent will be fine, but America won't reflect the same ideals and values and possibilities that we grew up with."", ""And I don't know about you, but I believe in a big, generous, optimistic, tolerant, vibrant, diverse America, not a cramped vision of what America can be. But we're going to have to fight for that vision. It's not going to be easy. And the only way that we're going to be successful in 2012 is if people feel as much passion and understand what's at stake and are willing to fight for the kind of America they believe in as we did back in 2008."", 'I still remember--you were mentioning Inauguration Day. What I remember is the night of the election. And we were in Chicago, and it was a really beautiful night. Everybody has fond memories of the ""Hope"" poster and Oprah crying. [Laughter] But I hope people also remember, I said, ""This is not the end, this is the beginning. This is just the start. And we didn\'t get into this fix overnight, and we\'re not going to get out of it overnight. We\'ve got a steep hill to climb.""', 'And Sheryl is right, we\'ve made enormous progress over the last 2½ years, everything from making sure 30 million people have health care who didn\'t have it before, to making sure that we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars, to making sure that we ended ""don\'t ask, don\'t tell,"" to making sure that we signed into law the basic notion that there should be equal pay for equal work, to getting 100,000 troops out of Iraq. We\'ve made enormous progress, but we\'ve got a lot more work to do. And I\'m ready to do it, but I can only do it if I\'ve got your help.', ""So I appreciate you being here tonight. But understand, just as we were just starting on election night, I'll tell you what, we're not even halfway through our journey yet. We've got a lot more work to do, and I'm going to need all of you to be willing to join me."", 'All right, thank you very much.', '']","

And you will recall--maybe you won't, but I'm going to remind you--[laughter]--I said, this is not the end, this is the beginning. This is the beginning."", ""Because what I said to the American people that night was that for almost a decade too many Americans had felt as if the American Dream was slipping away. We had seen economic growth and corporate profits and a stock market that had gone up, but there were too many folks who were struggling each and every day, working as hard as they could, being responsible for their families, being responsible to their communities, but somehow, they just couldn't keep up. Wages and incomes had flatlined, even though the cost of everything from health care to college tuitions to gas had all skyrocketed."", ""Around the world, the impression of America as a preeminent force for good had lost sway. We were in the midst of two wars. We didn't seem to be able to tackle challenges that had confronted us for decades: didn't have an energy plan that was worthy of the greatness of America; didn't have an immigration system that would allow us to be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants; had a school system in which we had no longer--we were no longer at the top and weren't preparing our young people to meet the challenges and demands of the 21st-century global interdependent economy."", ""And so when I started the race for President, what I said to all of you was, if you're looking for easy answers, you're looking in the wrong place. If you're looking for just a bunch of partisan rhetoric, I'm probably not your guy. But if you want to join me on this journey, to make sure that America is living up to its ideals, if you wanted to reclaim that sense that in America anything is possible if we're willing to work for it, and if you wanted to see if we could get beyond some of the politics of the past and point towards the future, then I wanted you to be a part of this process. And so all that culminated in Grant Park that night."", ""But then I said, you know what, this just gives us the opportunity to do what's possible. This is not the end state.

And with the help of people like Debbie and Pedro, we've made enormous strides. With the help of you, we have made enormous strides. I mean, think about it. An economy that was contracting is now growing. An economy that was shedding millions of jobs, we've seen over 2 million jobs created in the last 15 months, in the private sector. Financial system stabilized. And some of the decisions that we made were not popular. Everybody acts now like, well, yes, that was easy. [Laughter] Think about it."", ""Just think for a moment about the U.S. auto industry. We were on the verge of the liquidation of two of the three big automakers in the United States, Chrysler and GM. Now, there's been some revisionist history that's been offered lately about, well, they might have survived without our help, except nobody at GM or Chrysler believes that. They were going to break that up and sell off the spare parts. And as a consequence, you would have seen a million people, suppliers, dealerships, all gone, in the midst of this incredible hardship that people were already experiencing. And we made tough decisions, and we made the right decisions. And now we've got the Big Three automakers, all profitable, all increasing market share, hiring back workers."", ""And we didn't forget the promises that we had made during the campaign. We said we wanted to make sure that once again America would have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.

Let's take back billions of dollars and give it directly to young people so that millions of children--million of our kids are going to be able to go to college without $100,000 or $200,000 worth of debt."", ""We said we're going to start building a genuine clean energy industry in this country and made the largest investment in clean energy in our history. And we did that. We said that we'd begin the process of rebuilding our infrastructure in this country and made the largest investment rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our ports since Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s, putting hundreds of thousands of people to work all across America, doing the work that needs to be done."", ""We said we had to finally, after generations, deal with the travesty of the richest nation on Earth having people who went bankrupt because they went sick and couldn't afford to provide health care to their families, and we passed a historic health care law that is going to make sure that everybody in this country can get health care and is going to help drive prices down on health care in the bargain.

There's sort of a revisionist history about what was waiting for us when we began this Presidency. We were facing an economic crisis unlike any we had seen in generations: losing 700,000 jobs a month; financial system on the verge of meltdown; economists of every political persuasion, they were fearful that we might fall into a great depression. You remember that?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. And that's why we acted boldly and we acted swiftly to pass a Recovery Act that's made a difference in the lives of families across America. People don't, I think, remember where we were and where we are now. We put a tax cut into the pockets of small-business owners and 95 percent of working families—just like I promised during the campaign—the most progressive tax cut in history. Seven million families here in New York have benefited from it."", ""We extended unemployment insurance, increased unemployment insurance for 12 million Americans to help them get through tough times. That's helped millions of New Yorkers. We made COBRA 65 percent cheaper to make sure that if you were looking for a job, your family wouldn't go without health care. That was in the Recovery Act."", ""We gave relief to States, including New York, to help prevent more teachers and firefighters and police officers from being laid off. According to initial reports, 250,000 jobs in our schools were saved as a consequence of the Recovery Act, a quarter of a million teachers and educational specialists. We've supported more than 30,000 loans to small businesses, including 2,000 in this State alone. We've helped create thousands of private sector jobs."", ""But not only did we provide tax cuts, not only did we provide relief to States that needed it and individuals that were having a tough time—that's not just what this Recovery Act was about—we also happened to, in the Recovery Act, invest a greater sum in education than any time in our history and coupled that with critical reforms that had been bottlenecked in Congress for years."", ""The Recovery Act was the largest investment in clean energy in American history. It was the largest boost to medical research and basic research in history. It was the single largest investment in infrastructure since Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System back in the 1950s. And it's putting people back to work all across America rebuilding roads and bridges and dams."", ""So that was pretty good; that was the first month. [Laughter] But we didn't stop there. As Tim Kaine mentioned, we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, because I think women should get the pay the same as men for doing the same work. We lifted the ban on stem cell research and reaffirmed science to its rightful place in America. We extended health care to 11 million children in this country, including 4 million who didn't have health insurance.""]","

It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month."", ""At a moment like this, the last thing we can afford is four more years of the tired, old theory that says we should give more to billionaires and big corporations and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.

Voting for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed. Voting for the Bush budgets that spent us into debt. Calling for less regulation twenty-one times just this year. Those are the facts.', 'Senator McCain says that we can\'t spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change, but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old policies that have failed us for the last eight years.

We all suffer when that happens, and that is the problem with Senator Obama\'s approach to our economy. He is more interested in controlling wealth than in creating it, in redistributing money instead of spreading opportunity.

It\'s interesting how their definition of rich has a way of creeping down. At this rate, it won\'t be long before Senator Obama is right back to his vote that Americans making just 42,000 dollars a year should get a tax increase. We can\'t let that happen.', ""This Democratic Congress is planning all sorts of new taxes. This week, we are hearing they want to tax your 401k contributions.

Now is the time to grow our economy, and that's what I'm going to do."", ""My opponent's massive new tax increase is exactly the wrong approach in an economic slowdown. The answer to a slowing economy is not higher taxes, but that is exactly what is going to happen when the Democrats have total control of Washington. We can't let that happen.

He thinks taxes are too low, and I think that spending is too high.', ""If we are going to change Washington, we need a President who has actually fought for change and made it happen.

It's about rejecting fear and division for unity of purpose. That's how we've overcome war and depression. That's how we've won great struggles for civil rights and women's rights and worker's rights.

We just need a new direction. We need a new politics."", ""Now, I don't believe that government can or should try to solve all our problems. I know you don't either. But I do believe that government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide a decent education for our children; invest in new roads and new science and technology. It should reward drive and innovation and growth in the free market, but it should also make sure businesses live up to their responsibility to create American jobs, and look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road. It should ensure a shot at success not only for those with money and power and influence, but for every single American who's willing to work. That's how we create not just more millionaires, but more middle-class families. That's how we make sure businesses have customers that can afford their products and services. That's how we've always grown the American economy - from the bottom-up. John McCain calls this socialism. I call it opportunity, and there is nothing more American than that."", ""Understand, if we want get through this crisis, we need to get beyond the old ideological debates and divides between left and right.

That's the change we need."", ""When it comes to jobs, the choice in this election is not between putting up a wall around America or allowing every job to disappear overseas. The truth is, we won't be able to bring back every job that we've lost, but that doesn't mean we should follow John McCain's plan to keep giving tax breaks to corporations that send American jobs overseas. I will end those breaks as President, and I will give American businesses a $3,000 tax credit for every job they create right here in the United States of America. We'll create two million new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, and bridges, and schools, and by laying broadband lines to reach every corner of the country. And I will invest $15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new energy jobs over the next decade - jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and a new electricity grid; jobs building the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow, not in Japan or South Korea but here in the United States of America; jobs that will help us eliminate the oil we import from the Middle East in ten years and help save the planet in the bargain.

And it looks like we will pass that plan very soon.', ""But our job is far from over. Because now that we're fixing the mess on Wall Street, we need to move with the same sense of urgency to help families on Main Street. We don't just need a plan for bankers and investors, we need a plan for autoworkers and teachers and small business owners. I will continue to fight for an economic stimulus plan for working families - a plan that will help folks cope with rising food and gas prices, save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads, and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases. A plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those Americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones."", ""And I will fight every day of this campaign and every day of my presidency to make sure a crisis like this never, ever happens again. That means taking on the lobbyists and special interests in Washington. That means taking on the greed and corruption on Wall Street. That means putting in place the rules of the road and common-sense regulations for our finance system that I've been calling for since last March. It is time to reform Washington."", ""Now, my opponent, John McCain, talks about getting tough on Wall Street now, but he's been against the common-sense rules and regulations that could've stopped this mess for decades. He says he'll take on the corporate lobbyists, but he put seven of the biggest lobbyists in Washington in charge of his campaign. And if you think those lobbyists are working day and night to elect my opponent just to put themselves out of business, well I've got a bridge to sell you up in Alaska."", ""The truth is, for twenty-six years in Washington, Senator McCain has followed an out-of-touch philosophy he's followed for decades in Washington - the idea that if we give more and more to those with the most, prosperity will trickle down to everyone else; the idea that no harm will be done if we let lobbyists shred consumer protections and fight against every regulation as unwise or unnecessary."", 'Well what we have seen over the last few weeks is nothing less than the final verdict on this failed philosophy. And I am running for President of the United States because the dreams of the American people cannot be endangered anymore.', ""On Friday, we had a debate.

Barack Obama,Speech959_40:56,"[""When I got to Washington, we saw some of the worst corruption since Watergate. I led the fight for reform in my party, and let me tell you - not everyone in my party was too happy about it. When I proposed forcing lobbyists to disclose who they're raising money from and who in Congress they're funneling it to, I had a few choice words directed my way on the floor of the Senate. But we got it done, and we banned gifts from lobbyists, and free rides on their fancy jets. And I am the only candidate who can say that Washington lobbyists do not fund my campaign, they will not run my White House, and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am President of the United States. That's how we're going to end the outrage of special interests tipping the scales."", ""The most important thing we must do is restore opportunity for all Americans. To get our economy growing, we need to recapture that fundamental American promise. That if you work hard, you can pay the bills. That if you get sick, you won't go bankrupt. That your kids can get a good education, and that we can leave a legacy of greater opportunity to future generations."", ""That's the change the American people need. While Senator McCain likes to talk about change these days, his economic program offers nothing but more of the same. The American people need more than change as a slogan- we need change that makes a real difference in your life."", ""Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start-ups - that's how we'll grow our economy and create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow."", ""I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. My opponent doesn't want you to know this, but under my plan, tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan. If you make less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increase one single dime. In fact, I offer three times the tax relief for middle-class families as Senator McCain does - because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class."", ""I will finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And I will stop insurance companies from discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most"", ""I will create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy. We'll tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced"", ""And now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. But in exchange, I will ask for higher standards and more accountability.

So she would work the night shift from 2:30 in the morning until 10 o'clock, and then go back and start school. She got three hours of sleep every night. And she didn't expect government to solve all her problems. All she was hoping for was maybe government could give her a little bit of a hand up -- help make sure her sister got decent health care; help make sure that she was able to afford to go to college."", ""The campaign's not about me. It's not about John or Hillary or McCain. It's about her. It's about every American who's worried about losing their home right now, because nobody was providing oversight and regulation when the mortgage lenders were offering a bunch of predatory loans. It's about all the Americans who have watched their wages and incomes decline, although they're working one job, two jobs, sometimes three jobs at the same time as the wealthiest Americans have never had it better.

So I am wondering how your own experiences with her illness, and with the medical system generally, have molded your views about changing the system, and try to be as detailed as possible?"", ""EDWARDS: Well, they played a role. We have, through Elizabeth's health care problems, we've had a great deal of experience with the health care system and the difficulties that — and we have great health insurance — but even the difficulties that people with insurance have, which are far less than the people who have no health coverage. And I would add to that, that we've had, because of Elizabeth's experience, we have lots of people who come to us with their personal health care stories. So I think those two things in combination have given us an insight into how — how much the health care — the dysfunction of the health care system dominates people's lives in a way that it's overwhelming, in many cases. For example, single mothers who come to us say they've been diagnosed with breast cancer, they don't have health care and they have no idea what to do. I've seen how difficult going through Elizabeth's breast cancer treatment is for us with good health care coverage. I mean it's almost hard to imagine how hard it is for women going through the similar circumstance. And then also just the work I have done on the ground, on poverty, has put me in contact with lots of people around the country, who, because I go to a lot of community action centers, shelters, places that take care of and help the poor, puts me in contact with a lot of people with no health coverage. And so I think all those things in combination have had a significant impact."", ""SACK: Has there been anything specifically in her treatment that has given you a firsthand look at that dysfunction, whether it's from insurance companies, with payments being refused, kicked back, paperwork, medical errors or anything like that?"", ""EDWARDS: Yes, I mean when you get the statements by the providers and the insurance companies about what's covered and what's not covered, even for two people who are well versed in the law and experienced with the health care system, it seems completely arbitrary in many cases. It doesn't make any sense."", ""And if it's hard for us to understand, number one, probably that's because many times it's nonsensical and not based on anything legitimate. And secondly it's just, I can just imagine what it's like for people who have no legal training or any reason to understand. I mean, I think there's so many, even if you have health coverage, there are so many barriers set up to actually getting payment for the services, the health care services people need, that I am sure it's just overwhelming."", ""SACK: You boast along the campaign trail about being the first to produce a health care plan, and I guess I am curious about why voters should care about that. What does that tell them about you, relative to the other candidates? Isn't the more relevant question whose plan is best? Seems like some people could argue that, yeah you have the first plan, but you've also been running the longest so that wouldn't necessarily be a surprise. Tell voters why it's important that you were first."", ""EDWARDS: Well, I think they're both important. I think coming first is an indication of how you prioritize health care. How important it is to what you want to do as president. I came out with my plan — you should check this, but I think it was February.

Number two — that I think by getting out and being specific, about universal, about the substance of the plan, it also has the effect of driving the debate.

So I think it means something, number one — I think it means how I am prepared to lead on this issue as president. Number two — I wasn't waiting to see what others said to figure out what the politics were. I knew what I wanted to do. And number three — I think it helped drive the debate in the presidential race.

So I think it's a combination of what I saw as an increasing dysfunction, an increasing number of uninsured, health insurance premiums continuing to skyrocket, plus my personal contact with so many people telling me their stories. I mean, if I can be a little more specific about this, I mean, one of the things I did in the interim between 2004 and announcing for president a few years later, was traveling around the country to lots of places, lots of states and going into centers that were helping low-income families, and that put me in a position of constantly talking to single moms, to the uninsured, about the problems that they were faced with and what impact it was having on their lives, and that also had an effect on me."", ""SACK: Did you notice a change in the country's attitude towards health insurance between '04 and '08?"", ""EDWARDS: Yes, but I wouldn't want to overstate the case. I think there has been a significant change in the country's attitude since the '90s, so I think it's gone over a period of time. I think it's become more intense since 2003, 2004. And the problems have become increasingly worse, have become worse, but I think it's been on a continuum."", 'SACK: The insurance companies are prominent on your list of villains, along with the pharmaceutical companies, the oil companies.

When we were doing the Medicare prescription drug law in the Senate."", ""And those of us who were working on it — again, it was not just me, there were many people working on it — it became clear that there were certain things that needed to happen. We should have been using the power of the government to negotiate the best price, we should be allowing prescription drugs to be reimported from Canada, we should be using the power we have to try to regulate drug company advertising on television, those kind of things. And the drug company lobby was a powerful force in preventing those things. And, the same thing happened more recently with the effort by Congress to do something about reverse payments, these payments that are being made by drug companies to generics to keep cheaper drugs, generic drugs, off the market. Congress took up the issue and planned to do something about it and the drug company lobby effectively killed it. I think these are just examples. I encountered the insurance company lobby directly when John McCain, Senator Kennedy and I got the Patients' Bill of Rights passed in the Senate. It later got killed, but it got passed in the Senate. I know how effective they are and I know how much money they spend to prevent the kind of reform that, in my judgment, this country needs."", 'SACK: In shaping your plan why did you decide against single-payer that would guarantee universal coverage? If you hate the insurance companies so much why not put them out of business with one swift blow?', 'EDWARDS: Completely fair question. I looked hard at single-payer. Proponents of single-payer have some very strong arguments, particularly the elimination of profit motive in a health care system. Medicare, for example, runs at 3 to 4 percent overhead compared to some insurance companies charging 30 to 40 percent profit and overhead, so I thought that there was a legitimate and strong argument for it.', 'But I also believed that there are an awful lot of Americans who like the health care they have and are nervous about entirely government-controlled health care. So I heard both sides, and by the way throughout this campaign I\'ve heard both sides. I\'ll never forget, I had an event in Concord, N.H., not long ago where a guy stood up and said, ""I don\'t understand why you are not proposing single-payer. The Canadian system is a good system."" Not 15 minutes later a woman on the other side of the room said, ""I just want to say, I like the idea of universal health care but my"" — she had a relative, I\'ve forgotten what — ""living in Canada and she has to wait six months to get the tests that I can get in a week.""', 'So I think people are very divided over that issue.

Because you are introducing the Medicare-plus as you describe it, a federal plan that people would have the option to choose, that the plan could gravitate in either direction.

And is it O.K. by you if does eventually morph into a single-payer system?"", ""EDWARDS: There is nothing backdoor about it. It's right through the front door. We're going to let America decide what health care system works for them. I'm not deciding that for them. America's going to decide it. American health consumers will decide which works best. It could continue to be divided. But it could go in one direction or the other and one of the directions is obviously government or single payer. And I'm not opposed to that, as I've said many times. I think that if we're doing what needs to be done to seriously and comprehensively reform the system — cover everybody, dramatically reduce costs — I think there are roughly $120-125 billion of savings each year in this proposal that I have made.

If you think we need serious, comprehensive reform, you should vote for me.', ""SACK: Let's talk about whether Americans should be required to have insurance. You and Senator Clinton say that you have to have a mandate to reach universal coverage. Senator Obama respectfully disagrees. He'd only mandate coverage for children. A lot of commentators say that in the larger context of Democratic versus Republican positioning on health care that this difference is so small as to be insignificant. Are they wrong? Do you think that Obama's position is a serious shortcoming? Or is this sort of a minor disagreement that's being magnified to play to certain constituencies in the primaries?"", ""EDWARDS: The threshold question of any health care plan is 'Is it universal?' and his plan is not universal. So I don't think it's a minor thing. I think it's a serious thing. He's to be applauded for coming out with a serious plan, let's be fair. But his plan is not universal, and to argue that it's universal is not the truth."", ""I believe that his argument against mandates, which he made Monday night — did you watch the debate Monday night — which he made Monday night and I made the comparison then to Social Security. To me, it's like arguing that you should be able to opt out of Social Security. No, we've decided that as a nation this is a comprehensive plan for all seniors and everyone's going to be part of it. The same is true of a universal health care plan. So I think there is a fundamental divide between my plan and Senator Clinton's plan and his, because ours are universal and his is not. And I think we need universal care."", ""SACK: Define the term for me. How universal is universal? What we're learning from the experience in Massachusetts is they can't really cover everybody even though they've got a mandate. They're offering exceptions for people who can't afford it even in a heavily subsidized system and while their enrollment is doing pretty well, it's clear to them that there are going to be some people who just calculate the penalty as preferable to the mandate. The Schwarzenegger plan that's being considered in California would also leave some people out. So, is universal near-universal or is there really a way to cover every American?"", ""EDWARDS: First let's distinguish between what I'm proposing and what Senator Obama is proposing. His plan has no mandate. I have seen some calculations that indicate there could be as many as 12-15 million people could be left uncovered. What you're asking about now are people that may fall in the cracks. We will do everything in our power to cover everybody. Basically what happens is — and I actually haven't heard Senator Clinton say how she would enforce her mandate, so I'm not sure what she would do — I've heard some talk from some of the people who work for her but I haven't heard her say it. What our mandate would do is anytime people come into contact with the system, whether it's in the hospital or paying their taxes etc., and they're not enrolled in something — Medicaid, S-CHIP, private insurance, Medicare plus — then they will be enrolled. Let's go to the next step, you can play this out. If they then refuse to pay their premiums, it will be our responsibility as a nation to go collect the premiums."", 'SACK: Thru what mechanisms?']","

So, the big mechanisms for cost containment are, for the private insurers, they have to put 85 cents of every health care dollar into health care, which effectively caps profit and overhead at 15%. For the drug companies, they, we're going to reform the patent system. We're going to make it easier to get generics into the market more quickly. And take a very hard look at drugs that could have a real impact on low and moderate income families, whether instead of providing a patent, we pay a cash award.

Beyond that, required electronic record keeping. Excuse me, required use of technology, and electronic record keeping."", ""And then in a bigger-picture way, the whole concept of the system is cradle-to-grave coverage, but not just for when you get really sick. So that we — essentially the idea is this — that from the time children are very young, they're taught nutrition, health, well-being, exercise. When they develop a health care problem, since preventive care is 100% covered, we make sure we intervene, we're monitoring closely, we intervene as early as possible in their health care problem, so that whether they're young or old the patient does not get catastrophically sick. I mean, we know that one of the big problems in our health care system today is people that don't have coverage or who are worried about their coverage just put off getting care because they don't want to incur the expense, and as a result they get catastrophically sick. It's bad for them — bad for the patient — and bad for costs because it drives up costs.

Could you do it without Republican support, because you're pretty much declaring war on interests that they are allied with?"", ""EDWARDS: Well, I think that there are two things that have to be done simultaneously. One is you have to galvanize America behind the cause. And the most powerful tool the president has is the bully pulpit.

That is done simultaneous with reaching out to the leadership of the Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans, and I do believe there are — I'll give you an example — I had a debate with Newt Gingrich a couple of years ago in California, and the subject of health care came up, and he made a very comprehensive, and I wish I could remember, I believe it was universal, health care proposal. Now it was very different than mine, but he believed, clearly, that some sort of comprehensive health care was needed."", ""So I think that because of the will that exists today that didn't exist a decade or more ago, I think the public will, bringing America to the cause, and being able to work not just with Democrats but with Republicans, who are hearing the same thing from their constituents that I hear all over this country, I think there's an enormous opportunity. And I think what will ultimately control is first the power of a good idea, second, the political will in America to actually create reform, and third, I think the political leadership of Democratic and Republican, recognize that this is something that's time has come."", 'SACK: Small businesses are obviously very scared about these mandatory plans.

Small businesses who are struggling to pay their costs, most of the small businesses — and I've spoken to many all over the country — are terrified about health care costs. They have no market power, they can't negotiate a decent price. It's not just covering their employees, by the way, they can't cover themselves, so it's their own family that's being impacted by this dysfunctional health care system. And so what I say to them, and I've said it repeatedly, is you are an enormous beneficiary of this health care reform that we are proposing. Because what effectively do is give you the same kind of market power that General Motors or IBM or some large American employer has, and because of that you're going to be able to cover yourself, you'll going to be able to cover your employees, and the net result of it is both good for the people who work for you and good for you.

I believe in the jury system. What I am in favor of is keeping cases out of the system that don't belong there. And what I would do is say to any lawyer who's considering filing a malpractice case, you must first have the case reviewed by an independent expert, who determines that the case is both meritorious and serious, you have to certify that in order for the case to be filed in the court system, and now we get to the part you made reference to, if you fail to do that then the lawyer will be held financially responsible, and if you do it three times, there's a three-strikes-and-you're-out rule. That's basically what I'm proposing."", 'SACK: So what would your authority be to impose that in the states? Or is it a bully pulpit issue?', ""EDWARDS: It can be done either way.

When you hear people in Washington talking about all the money that's been appropriated for Louisiana, stop and ask yourself how much of that money has actually been delivered to the people of Louisiana."", ""So let's do for New Orleans and the surrounding parishes what was done for New York after 9/11. Waive the rule requiring matching funds to get federal money for infrastructure improvements. And, let's create a user-friendly, flexible, streamlined process to get funding for public works projects. Here's one of the things that drives people crazy, they're trying to get flood money through a program called a program called Community Development Block Grant to service the mass to get the money from FEMA, you have to get the environmental assessment. Trying to get the money from FEMA, you need to have an environmental assessment. Don't you think they could talk together and one single environmental assessment, instead of requiring people to spend 40 and 50 thousand dollars to get two assessments? This is the kind bureaucratic nonsense that has stood in the way of rebuilding. And once a community has applied for funds, let's provide a small amount of money upfront, so you can get started on their project while they're waiting for approval."", 'And let\'s come together and finally find a way to make the ""Road Home"" program actually work for the people of Louisiana. I was in the Broadmoor neighborhood yesterday, I met with Mrs. Johnson, a widow, raised six children in her home. Unfortunately she paid fifty thousand dollars to a contractor who turned out to be unscrupulous. And the work done on her home does not meet the standards of the city. So, she is still living in one of the trailers. How many of you have been in one of the FEMA trailers? So, you know how difficult it is. And across the street, Mr. Washington is paralyzed on one side, a retired gentleman trying to save his home. Wondering when he is going to get the help to do the work that he needs to do. It is heartbreaking to see people who are decent hardworking Americans neglected by their government. One of the things we need is more people to help.', ""Third, let's create a Gulf Coast Corps of dedicated men and women who would work fulltime to help our communities rebuild. Congressmen Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and other Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are working on a similar idea. I would envision the Corps having two separate parts, one that would provide financial incentives to skilled professionals -- teachers, doctors, nurses and others to serve high-need areas."", 'The other working hand-in-hand with the building trades union would consist of workers and apprentices who would complete priority projects. Many would be local -- and many would be able to return to get jobs that paid well,. And you could work with local communities to help restore our fire stations, the hospitals, sewers and so much else.']","

While homeownership has risen, programs that help hard-pressed families put a roof over their head have been cut. Those are the people we need to help the most.

Here are the facts. Mr. Nixon in 1952 and 1956 joined in reckless political promises, never to be kept, in support of the so-called liberation policy that was going to aid revolutions behind the Iron Curtain through airdrops, coordination, and other direct assistance. In 1954 he tried to get us involved in a hopeless colonial war by recommending the dispatch of American troops to fight in Indochina. In 1958 his goodwill tour of Latin America ended by endangering the prestige of the United States - when he disregarded the advice of our diplomats and allies, and permitted his presence to provoke arguments and disorders of such violence that the Marines had to be called out to safeguard his homecoming.', ""Secondly, does Mr. Nixon's record demonstrate that he is a man whose judgment of world events and future crises is sufficiently farsighted to lead this Nation in the sixties? Here are the facts. On the basis of his visit with Khrushchev, he predicted that the U-2 incident would not affect the summit conference. He was wrong. On the basis of his visit to Cuba, he praised the competence and stability of the Batista dictatorship, and said communism could never take over in that island. He was wrong. On the basis of his trip to Russia, he predicted that the exchange of visits with Khrushchev would develop deeper respect between the two governments. He was wrong, again."", 'He tells us now that he\'s the man to debate with Khrushchev - but the best he could do in that Moscow kitchen was to wag his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s face and say: ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust, but we\'re ahead of you in color television."" He tells us now that economic aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro - but he neglects to say that he was there 5 years ago and didn\'t do anything about it. He tells us now that his trips abroad were a valuable experience - but the facts are that every key area he has visited is less friendly to western views now than it was at the time of his visit: Ghana, Laos, Cuba, Panama, and at least 10 others.', 'The great tragedy of American foreign policy in all of these areas was our failure to recognize the situation before the crisis developed. Mr. Nixon was there - presumably he saw what was going on - presumably he made recommendations. But it is apparently an unfortunate fact that for all these years a trip by Mr. Khrushchev or Mr. Mikoyan has had a far greater effect on our foreign policy than a trip by Mr. Nixon. Mr. Nixon would like us to forget the fact that he did not foresee these crises, or recommend new policies, or secure their adoption. But the American people will not forget. For they know that experience counts.', 'Third and finally, has Mr. Nixon been willing to keep sufficiently well-informed - or keep the American people accurately informed - about the state of the world and American foreign policy? Here are the facts. He asserted in our fourth debate that official surveys of our falling prestige abroad related to the 1957 post sputnik era - and we now know that statement to be incorrect. He asserted that the Communist-oriented regime in Guatemala was replaced as the result of our quarantine - and the information available to every diplomat and reporter proves that this is incorrect.

While we meet tonight in the Golden Gate of California, the rescue squad has been completing its operation in the city of New York. [Laughter and applause.] Governor Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge, the Vice President, and President Eisenhower [response from the audience] all rode up together. I thought it was very unfair not to have Barry Goldwater along. [Laughter.] We have all seen these circus elephants complete with tusks, ivory in their head and thick skins, who move around the circus ring and grab the tail of the elephant ahead of them. [Laughter.]', 'Dick Nixon grabbed that tail in 1952 and 1956, but this year he faces the American people alone. [Applause.] We are not choosing a team; we are not choosing a triumvirate. We are choosing a President of the United States. [Applause.] President Eisenhower is not running. Mr. Nixon is. And the American people have to choose between Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party that he represents, and the Democratic Party and progress. And I ask your support. I come here and ask your support. [Applause.]', 'I cannot believe that a State like California, which is committed to progress - I cannot believe that California or the Nation, on next Tuesday, in the most difficult and dangerous and revolutionary period in world history, can put the control of this country in the hands of those who have opposed progress for 25 years. [Applause.]', 'I come here tonight and I ask your support in picking this country up and moving it forward. [Applause.] One week from tonight the next President of the United States will be turning to the arduous task that lies ahead, the preparation of a legislative program, the selection of men and women to serve our country, and of preparation for the fight for peace abroad. But whoever our next President may be, his efforts for a successful policy abroad will depend on the men and women whom he selects to conduct that policy.', 'Speaking in this State a month ago, Mr. Nixon showed an incapacity to grasp the essential fact. He set up a new machinery intended to win the struggle for peace and freedom. But it turned out to be nothing more than a series of conferences, committees, and goodwill tours. This should come as no surprise. For the last 8 years we have faced problem after problem, and the solution to each of them has been to appoint a committee. I think it is time for action. I think it is time we met our problems. [Applause.]', 'It takes more than words, hard or soft, more than tours, more than parades, more than conferences. It takes a stronger America, militarily, economically, scientifically, and educationally. We need a stronger free world, a stronger attack on world poverty, a stronger United Nations, a stronger United States foreign policy speaking for a stronger America, and that is what we are going to get. [Applause.] We can push a button to start the next war but there is no push button magic to winning a lasting and enduring peace. To be peace loving is not enough, for the Sermon on the Mount saved its blessings for the peacemakers. The generation which I speak for has seen enough of warmongers. Let our great role in history be that of peacemakers. [Applause.] But in the two areas, two areas where peace can he won in the field of disarmament and in our representations abroad this country has been ill served.', 'Disarmament planning is the most glaring omission in the field of national security and world peace of the last 8 years. [Applause.] This administration has less than 100 people working full time on the subject in the entire National Government. This is one-fifth as many Government employees as take care of the cemeteries and memorials for the U.S. Battle Commission. [Applause.] One hundred people working for peace. As a result we have gone to every conference unprepared. Our chief negotiator admitted at the 1958 conference on preventing surprise attacks that we, and I quote him, ""hadn\'t up to this time really given the intense study of the kind of measure which would make this kind of measure possible,"" had not even intense study to the very program that they were then putting forward.', 'A year ago when we went to the disarmament conference, we appointed an attorney from Massachusetts to set up an ad hoc committee. That committee met for 3 months. It was then dismissed. Four months before the conference began we drafted an attorney from New York to head our mission.', 'The result was we had no program and we accepted that of the British. How could we be so indifferent to one of our great chances for peace. We are going to have to do better. [Applause.] If we are successful on Tuesday, we are going to set up in the National Government a national peace agency, an arms research institute [applause], to prepare the studies which are necessary, to conduct the scientific research which is essential if we are going to speak with vigor and precision in this vital area of opportunity.']","

John F. Kennedy,Speech1922_10:22,"[""Secondly, we are going to have to be better represented. We are going to have to have the best Americans we can get to speak for our country abroad. All of us have admired what Dr. Tom Dooley has done in Laos. [Applause.] And others have been discouraged at the examples that we read of the ugly American. And I think that the United States is going to have to do much better in this area if we are going to defend freedom and peace in the 1960's. [Applause.] For the fact of the matter is that out of Moscow and Peiping and Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany are hundreds of men and women, scientists, physicists, teachers, engineers, doctors, nurses, studying in those institutes, prepared to spend their lives abroad in the service of world communism. A friend of mine visiting the Soviet Union last summer met a young Russian couple studying Swahili and African customs at the Moscow Institute of Languages. They were not language teachers. He was a sanitation engineer and she was a nurse, and they were being prepared to live their lives in Africa as missionaries for world communism."", 'This can only be countered by skill and dedication of Americans who are willing to spend their lives serving the cause of freedom. [Applause.] The key arm of our Foreign Service abroad are the Ambassadors and members of our missions. Too many have been chosen - too many ambassadors have been chosen who are ill equipped and ill briefed. Campaign contributions have been regarded as a substitute for experience. [Applause.] Men who lack compassion for the needy here in the United States were sent abroad to represent us in countries which were marked by disease and poverty and illiteracy and ignorance, and they did not identify us with those causes and the fight against them. They did not demonstrate compassion there. Men who do not even know how to pronounce the name of the head of the country to which they are accredited, as we saw 2 years ago in the case of our Ambassador to Ceylon, have been sent to important countries, essential countries, in the struggle between East and West. How can they compete with Communist emissaries long trained and dedicated and committed to the cause of extending communism in those countries?', 'In 1958, it was reported that our Ambassador to Moscow was the only American Ambassador who could speak the language accredited behind the Iron Curtain, only one. Only two of the nine Ambassadors to the Arabic speaking countries spoke Arabic. In 8 of the 12 non-English speaking countries of Western Europe, our Ambassadors lack a workable knowledge of the language of the country to which they were accredited.', 'Our Ambassador to Paris could not even discuss negotiations with General de Gaulle, because he lacked that skill in French. A man who is ignorant of foreign languages. This country is going to have to do much better. [Applause.]', 'It was reported last month that 70 percent of all new Foreign Service officers had no language skill at all last year. Only 3 of 44 Americans in our Embassy in Belgrade could speak Yugoslavian. In Athens only 6 of 79 Americans spoke the modern language of Greek. In New Delhi, not a single American could speak an Indian dialect fluently. We cannot understand what is in the minds of other people if we cannot even speak to them. That is why we are given tongues. Yet do you think it is possible for us in the most deadly struggle in which freedom has ever been engaged to win if we approach it as casually as these statistics indicate that we are? [Response from the audience.]', 'After the key African state of Guinea, now voting with the Soviet Union in Communist foreign policy, after it gained its independence, a Russian Ambassador showed up the next day. Our Ambassador did not show up for 9 months. Today, we do not have a single American diplomat in residence in six new countries of Africa which are now members of the United Nations, not a single American diplomat in residence in any of the 6, and of the 16 new African countries which were admitted to the United Nations, do you know how many voted with us on the admission of Red China? None. There are only 26 Negroes in the 6,000 of our Foreign Service officers, and yet Africa today contains one-quarter of all the votes in the General Assembly. I think we can do better. [Applause.]', 'I therefore propose that our inadequate efforts in this area be supplemented by a peace corps of talented young men and women, willing and able to serve their country in this fashion for 3 years as an alternative or as a supplement to peacetime selective service [applause], well qualified through rigorous standards, well trained in the languages, skills, and customs they will need to know, and directed and paid by the ICA point 4 agencies.', 'We cannot discontinue training our young men as soldiers of war, but we also want them to be ambassadors of peace. [Applause.] The combat soldiers, like General Gavin, who jumped with his division in northern France, said that no young man today could serve his country with more distinction than in this struggle for peace around the world. [Applause.]', 'This would be a volunteer corps, and volunteers would be sought among not only talented young men and women, but all Americans, of whatever age, who wished to serve the great Republic and serve the cause of freedom, men who have taught or engineers or doctors or nurses, who have reached the age of retirement, or who in the midst of their work wished to serve their country and freedom, should be given an opportunity and an agency in which their talents could serve our country around the globe. [Applause.]', 'I am convinced that the pool of people in this country of ours anxious to respond to the public service is greater than it has ever been in our history. I am convinced that our men and women, dedicated to freedom, are able to be missionaries, not only for freedom and peace, but join in a worldwide struggle against poverty and disease and ignorance, diseases in Latin America and Brazil, which prevented any child in two villages in the last 12 months from reaching 1 year of age.', 'I think this country in the 1960\'s can start to move forward again, can demonstrate what a free society, freely moving and working can do.

[Applause.]', ""No one can say with any certainty what is ever going to happen on election day. But I want to make it very clear that when election day is finished, or, rather, when it begins, I will be satisfied and hope I will be satisfied when it is over. But in any case, I believe that the Democratic Party and this campaign is on the side of right, is on the side of the best long-range interests of our country, stands for the things I hope in 1960 which are in accordance with the best judgment that we can render on the needs of our country. I don't know of any Democratic candidates - certainly this is true of our vice-presidential candidate or myself - that have gone to the people in the election of 1960 and talked anything but the truth as we understood it, and as we saw it and what represented the needs of our country."", 'Two thousand years ago when Athens was under attack from the Macedonians, Demosthenes in a great speech said, ""Our trouble comes from those who wish to please us, rather than serve us."" I hope after this campaign is over in 1960, whether it is successful or not, though I hope it is successful, but whether it is successful or not, I hope it will be recorded that the Democratic Party and its candidates in 1960 sought to serve the people, not please them. [Applause.] And my best judgment is that those who in 1960 seek to serve the people also please them, and I think that is the mistake Mr. Nixon has made. [Applause.] To go through the United States and talk, about our unparalleled prosperity as if there are no clouds on the horizon bigger than a man\'s hand, to talk about our position in the world as higher and stronger and greater than it has ever been in the past, to sound no alarm bell in the night, to express no urgency, to fail to warn that these are dangerous and hazardous days, full of opportunity and also of trouble, in my opinion misleads rather than misinforms, and no free people can possibly maintain their freedom unless they and those who seek positions of responsibility are willing to face the facts of life, the facts with the bark off, the truth, and the truth in 1960 calls for the American people to render an accurate judgment of their position of their country, their position in history, where they have been and where they are going. We face new problems, entirely different from those that have faced the Eisenhower administration or that of Harry Truman or Franklin Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson. Those names may be invoked by both parties. But as we move across the frontier of 1960 into the sixties, the problems which our country will face of economic growth, of development of our resources, of the development of outer space, of fresh water from salt water, of food from the ocean, of new uses for old minerals, of the undeveloped world and its economic development, of the peaceful use of the atom, the control of atomic weapons, the developments in the camps of our adversaries between the Russians and the Chinese, the development of countries of Africa newly independent, but without the resources to maintain their independence in the traditional sense - all those are entirely new problems, requiring new people, new solutions, new ideas, and requiring above all a sense of dedication to the cause of freedom.', ""I do not find in the speeches of my opponent any sound of commitment to this new future, any awareness that we live in the most revolutionary of all times, that here in this old section of Pennsylvania which was the scene of a great revolutionary struggle at the beginning of our country, we move through a period far more revolutionary, far more promising, far more dangerous. So I come not merely as a contestant with Mr. Nixon for a prize. I come representing a point of view which I hope the majority of our fellow citizens share, that in the great days of the 1960's, we as Americans individually and as a country must measure up to the responsibility which has been placed upon us by our own free choice and by the pressure of history, to be the chief defenders of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe. I am confident that this country can meet its responsibilities. I see no peril, no burden that this country cannot sail through, unless we attempt to fool ourselves that these are easy, gentle, and prosperous times, without responsibility, without burden. We face an adversary who mobilizes all of the resources of the state for the service of the state. Young men and women in Moscow are studying esoteric dialectics of Africa and India, prepared to spend their lives in those countries as servants of international communism, prepared to work for the service of the state without regard to their own free choice. Young men and women in our universities pursue their own interest, if they should study language, occasionally French, some Spanish, and once in a while Russian. How many of those young men and women will be willing to spend their lives in far off lands in the service of freedom? The 1960's will require more from each of us than we have given in the past. But as for me, I am confident that this country will meet challenges. I am confident that we will continue to be the great defender of freedom, and I am more confident than ever that freedom will prevail. Thank you. [Applause.]"", '']","

Last year, the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world, and the result of that is this year only 50 percent of our steel mill capacity is being used. We have the highest unemployment in this month of any month except for the two recessions of 1954 and 1958, and the one in 1949, ever since 1945. This country is moving into a serious and difficult time in the life of our country, and in our relations around the world. We stand on the razoredge of history. In the next 10 years Africa and Asia and Latin America will begin to move in one direction or another, will begin to decide whether the future belongs to us or whether it belongs to the Communists, and I think our responsibility is to make this country move with sufficient vigor and sufficient force so the people around the world can decide the future belongs to us, to solve our problems, to build a better society here, to hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for leadership. I am not satisfied with the drift of events today. I am not satisfied to be reading every day that Khrushchev and Castro and the Chinese are on the upward march. I want to read that the United States is once again asserting its leadership as a great and free country, which offers a ray of hope to all those who wish to follow our example.', ""I think this is the most difficult time of our history, even more difficult than the 1930's. I think the election of Franklin Roosevelt insured the maintenance of freedom in this country. The great task for the United States is to defend the cause of freedom here and around the world in the sixties, by building a strong and vital country, by maintaining our defenses, by building an educational system second to none, by providing full employment for our people, and demonstrating that Mr. Khrushchev is wrong when he says the United States is a sick and dying and faltering horse. I don't believe it. I think we represent the way of the future. I think the Communist system is as old as Egypt. But I think it is our function as American citizens at this criticial time in our development to demonstrate our vigor and force again, to look to the future, to say we are not satisfied with things as they are, to say this is a great country that can be greater, a powerful country that can be more powerful.

Mr. Hutcheson, Mr. Lee, officers of the Carpenters Union, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate very much your generous invitation to come here today. I have served on the Labor Committees of the House and the Senate for over 14 years. I am now chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate, and I hope in that time I have come to have some idea of the problems that you face, the opportunities that are yours, and the responsibilities that are common to us as citizens of this country. This has been billed tonight as a great debate. But in effect the Carpenters Union today have heard one phase of the so-called great debate. [Laughter and applause.]', 'This morning you heard from the Vice President of the United States, who spoke on behalf of his party and his views, and I speak today as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party. The fact of the matter is that though we may debate tonight, and though we may discuss issues which face the United States in the domestic sphere, we have been debating in a very real sense these issues through all of the 20th century. I think since the beginning of Woodrow Wilson\'s administration, the two parties have taken different positions on the domestic problems that face the United States. I think the Democratic Party has said ""Yes"" to the future. I think the Democratic Party has recognized that there are obligations which the people have to serve the people, that the function of the Government is to serve the public interest, and I think it is for that reason that the Democratic Party nominated Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. I think the Republicans have had a different conception of their public responsibility, and I think it is because of that reason that they nominated McKinley, Taft, Harding, Coolidge, Landon, Dewey, and now we have today. [Applause and laughter.] The Vice President stated the issue as a simple one. He said the question is whether the private sector or the public sector moves ahead. He said the question is whether those of us who come with promises for the future, that we are going to be taking money out of the pockets of people that we promise to help. I don\'t see it that way at all. I don\'t think that there will be many carpenters working in the United States, and I don\'t think that there will be many homes built in the United States if there was not Federal guarantees for the building of those homes. Do you think many GI\'s would have come back at the end of World War II and bought new homes which your people helped to build unless they had been given guarantees of Federal credit? Do you think that there would be enough homes built in the next 15 years, and we are going to have to build more homes every year for the next 25 or 30 years than we have ever built in the past - do you think they could possibly be done without Federal credit, without urban renewal, without home loan guarantees? I don\'t think they could be at all.', 'I think there is a great place and a major place for private responsibility and for individual enterprise. It is the system upon which our country is founded. It provides great prosperity, and it provides great freedom. But there is also a responsibility for the people, working as a whole, if they are going to develop the resources of our country, if they are going to provide employment for our people, if they are going to provide homes for our people, and Federal policy affects that program as sharply as any other factor. Do you think that your people will work as much when interest rates go to the highest they have been in 20 years? Frank Church said at the Democratic Convention that Rip Van Winkle could go to sleep and could wake up and tell whether the Republicans or Democrats were in control of the Government by asking how high the interest rates were. [Laughter and applause.]', 'Now let us get it clear on the record, because there are sharp differences between our two parties. The Democratic Congress passed a housing bill last year which I think would have met the needs of our economy, the needs of our people, and that bill was vetoed. This year, the Democratic Congress in the Senate passed another bill and it went to the Rules Committee of the House, and we could not get a single Republican in the House Rules Committee to vote to send it to the floor. They joined with three Democrats who were opposed to the program and they killed the housing bill this year which our people need and which will cause your people to work.', ""So the record is very clear. I support the affirmative policy which will move this country's economy ahead, which will build homes, which will keep our people working, and provide an unparalleled level of prosperity. If that is the issue, let us join it, because I never voted against any program which I felt would serve the people, which was soundly financed, soundly based, which was within the means of our people to afford, and which would sustain our prosperity. If the housing industry fails to move ahead, we not only find our people badly housed, but we don't find our people working. The automobile industry, the steel industry, and the housing industry are the three industries that must move if the economy of our country is going to move. And I don't think you can possibly feel satisfied when there are 15 million American families living in substandard housing; when there are 5 million American homes in the cities of the United States which lack plumbing of any kind; when at our present rate of constructing homes you are going to have more slums by the year 2000 than you have today: when urban renewal, which is the hope of the older cities of the East from where I come, our only hope of sustaining ourselves, when urban renewal is opposed, and vetoed and blocked, and when interest rates are so high that if a man buys a $20,000 house today, he pays over a 30-year mortgage nearly $8,000 more than he might have paid in 1952. So I would just as soon join the issue, and I would just as soon debate this matter, and I would just as soon have the American people make their decision. I am no Johnny-come-lately to situs picketing, either. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""I don't know what that means [laughter] I will tell you what my position is. I am in favor of amending the Denver Building Trades case, and so introduced a bill, so supported it, so tried to get it out of the subcommittee and did, so tried to get it out of the full committee where it was filibustered to death in the last session of the Congress. So while we may not be Johnny-come-latelies, I would like to know what our individual position is on this question. I want to make it clear what my position is. It is my understanding that when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, it was very clear by the remarks of Senator Taft, that he did not envision that there would be a prohibition against the union activities at a primary site in order to protect its working standards. It would not be called - when there were subcontractors involved - it would not be called a secondary boycott. That is what I mean by changing the Denver case. And I think that the next Congress of the United States, and whether I sit in the office of the Presidency or whether I continue as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, we are going to move again on that next January, and we invite all those, early or late, to come and join us. [Applause.]"", ""Finally, let me say that I know Mr. Khrushchev, too, but Mr. Khrushchev is not the enemy. Mr. Khrushchev could pass from the scene. He is 65 or 66 years of age, and all men are mortal, and he could pass as Stalin passed, and the enemy would remain the same. The enemy is the Communist system, and the enemy of the Communist system, the chief adversary of the Communist system, is our system. Therefore, the question before us is not the question of comparative growth and statistics, compared to what we did 10 years ago or 15 years ago or 20 years ago. The question for the American people to decide in the sixties is are we doing enough to defend ourselves, are we doing enough to sustain ourselves, are we strengthening ourselves and the cause of freedom around the world? That is the question before us. Not argument with Mr. Khrushchev. The system that is opposing us is strong and powerful, both because of its ideology and because of the productive power of the Soviet Union. We are strong and powerful and I think stronger and more powerful because we believe that freedom, and because of our productive capacity in the United States, and therefore the people of this country have to decide by November 8 which way they want to go; whether they feel that everything that could be done is being done, whether the program offered by the Republican Party offers hope to the people, whether in 1964, at the end of the next President's administration, our power and prestige will be increasing relative to that of the Communists or whether we will be standing still and the world will begin to move in the direction of the East rather than in the direction of the West. That is the issue and it cannot be dismissed, and it cannot be put aside by saying we need an argument in a kitchen or out of a kitchen. What we need is strength. [Applause]"", ""I don't care how skilled Mr. Khrushchev is or how skilled the next President is in debate. What counts is the power of the two systems, and where they are going, and what they stand for, and how they associate themselves with the people of the world.

Officers of the Chemical Workers, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here today, and I am delighted to be in the company of my colleague in the Congress of the United States, my colleague on the Labor Committee, your next speaker Congressman James Roosevelt [applause] and with the distinguished Governor of the State of New Jersey, Robert Meyner [applause].', 'I come here today not only as the candidate of the Democratic Party in this most vital election, but I come here as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate, after having served for over 14 years on the Labor Committees of the Congress. The United States is faced today with a difficult and dangerous period of history and I think that in the coming week or two, the greatest sense of responsibility, the greatest restraint will be placed upon all of us, those of us who conduct the campaigns in this difficult time, upon the President of the United States, upon the Secretary of State. So that when the present period of tension which now exists at the United Nations shall be over, we shall find, I hope, the United States in a stronger position rather than in a weaker position. Therefore, what I say to you today is devoted to what we can do in our own area of competence in order to strengthen the United States.', ""I think that those of you who are members of this important union recognize that the 1960's are going to bring you union problems because it is going to bring the United States many industrial changes, and many problems which will affect your union, and also affect the men and women who work in the chemical industry."", 'In your paper, the Chemical Workers, which is distributed here and which I was just looking at, there is an article on page 9 which I would like to see the next President of the United States study very carefully, whoever he may be, and that is the article which says, ""Automation turns from blue to white."" [Applause.]', 'I have traveled in the last 2 years to every State in the United States. I spent a month in West Virginia, and I saw not only the coal mines of West Virginia and the coal miners who had been displaced - I spent some days in McDowell County, W. Va., which mines more coal than it ever has in history and has more families receiving more surplus food packages than any county of the United States. But I also traveled in the Ohio Valley, and in the Kanawha Valley, which has two great industrial complexes which particularly feature chemical production, and there we would drive for yard after yard or walk yard after yard and every 100 yards we would see one worker or two workers and this tremendous industrial complex, administered by relatively few men when I am sure 15 or 20 years ago in a comparable output we would have seen dozens and hundreds of men and women working in those plants.', 'The task which faces you as a union is to adjust yourselves to these tremendous industrial changes which are going to bring white-collar workers where blue-collar workers once dominated. The problem for us as citizens of the United States, the problem for us, those of us who serve in the Government, in the Congress or in the executive branch, is how we can maintain full employment, how we can absorb the production of our industries, how we can provide for the orderly transition from present production methods into new production methods without displacing our workers, how we can in short in the steel industry, in the chemical industry, in the oil industry, in the newspaper industry, how we can provide labor-saving machinery at the same time maintaining full employment, at the same time making sure that those machines produce a better life rather than a life of unemployment for so many of our citizens. [Applause.]', ""I consider that to be in agriculture and industry the No.1 domestic problem which the next President of the United States is going to have to face. I don't think this administration really has thought about it at all. I do not recall except occasional speeches, spaced months apart, where this Government has turned its attention to the problems of automation, to the problems of employment, to the problems of maintaining full employment in a technological revolution here at home as well as around the world."", ""I would think that one of the first things that the next President of the United States must do is to call a conference of the Federal Government of the basic industries, the managers of the basic industries, the leaders of organized labor in the basic industries, to consider what steps can be taken to provide for the orderly transition of new machinery into our Government, into our industry; in other words, to address ourselves as a national problem, not as an industry problem, not as a company problem, but as a national problem to the problem of automation in the early 1960's. I think it is an entirely new problem, it is a problem which did not disturb the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman. It is a problem which is now on the horizon no bigger than a man's hand. But it is a problem which will disturb the lives of all of us in the next decade unless we move to it at once. I can assure you that if I am elected to the office of the Presidency, or if I maintain my position as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, that I think it is a problem to which we must address ourselves early in 1961. We will require the cooperation of the members of the Chemical Union. We will require the cooperation of the leadership of this union - the kind of studies which you are undertaking today, in cooperation with management in these companies, and in other industries stretching across the United States."", 'It is the kind of new problem which I think our party, which I am a member of, the Democratic Party, is best equipped to meet. [Applause.]', 'If there is one contribution or one quality for which the Democratic Party has been noted since its earliest beginnings, since the time of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, stretching through the administrations of Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman, it has been its willingness to break new ground, to look ahead, not to stand still. No Democrat has ever run for the Presidency with a motto, ""You Never Had It So Good."" Every Democratic President who has served this country in times of crisis has looked to the future. The slogans of our party in this century tell the story of our party; Woodrow Wilson\'s New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt\'s New Deal, Harry Truman\'s Fair Deal, Adlai Stevenson\'s New America, and now I talk today in 1960 about the New Frontiers of the 1960\'s. [Applause.]', ""No Democrat has ever run for the Presidency standing pat with McKinley or returning to normalcy with Harding, or keeping cool with Coolidge. [Applause.] Those who are satisfied with things as they are, those who wish to stand still, those who look back to the good old days, I don't think they should come with us in the 1960's. [Applause.] But those who want to move this country, those who think we can do better, those who think that there are better days still ahead, those who think that it is time that the Government and the people devoted themselves to the great unfinished business of our society - as Franklin Roosevelt did in his administration, and Woodrow Wilson in his, and Harry Truman in his - I hope they will come with us. [Applause.)"", ""We don't promise any easy future at home and abroad because there is no easy life for a citizen of the United States who bears his responsibilities in 1960. But we can say to you that the Democratic Party, as it has so often in the past, is prepared to lead; and if we are successful this country will move again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]"", '']","

When the next settlers arrived that colony had disappeared. But the daring of those men - the spirit which conquered America's first frontier - has never disappeared from North Carolina or from America. And I come here today to summon those same qualities of courage and strength and determination to the conquest of America's new frontier - the frontier of the sixties."", 'The pioneering of America\'s first settlers - from Roanoke Island in North Carolina to Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts - forms a historic link between your State and mine - between North and South. But there is another tie that binds us together just as firmly - and that is the Democratic Party. For it was two Great Southerners, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who in 1791 sailed up the Hudson River in what they described as a ""botanical expedition"" - to find new plants and catch butterflies - and there they met with New York political leaders, and founded the most enduring, the most progressive, and most effective political alliance in American history - the alliance of men of faith and foresight from the urban industrial North and the rural South - the alliance which was to become the only truly national party in our history - the Democratic Party. And I am not here to catch butterflies either - but to reaffirm that historic alliance and lead it to a great victory in 1961.', 'But I am not in search of victory alone. For, as Woodrow Wilson reminded us, ""The success of a party means little except when the Nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose."" Today, in 1960, I believe that the Democratic Party has such a purpose.', 'I believe that our success in November will mean the fulfillment of that purpose. And I believe that all America - North, South, East, and West - can unite to carry out that purpose. For we intend to build a strong and growing and prosperous America which can be the protector of freedom for all the world. That is the goal of the Democratic Party - that is the goal of North Carolina - and that is why we are going to have a Democrat in the White House in 1960.', 'And America needs a Democratic victory. We are a great and strong country - perhaps the greatest and strongest in the history of the world. But greatness and strength are not our natural right. They are not gifts which are automatically ours forever. It took toil and courage and determination to build this country - and it will take those same qualities if we are to maintain it. For, although a country may stand still, history never stands still.', 'Thus, if we do not soon begin to move forward again, we will inevitably be left behind. And I know that Americans today are tired of standing still - and that we do not intend to be left behind.', 'But effort and courage are not enough without purpose and direction. For, as Socrates told us, ""If a man does not know to what port he is sailing, no wind is favorable."" But today we Democrats know to what port we are sailing - we have mapped our destination and we know what kind of America we want the sixties to bring.', 'First, we want an America which is using all its resources - the natural wealth and skills of every region - to stimulate our free enterprise economy to new heights of production and abundance. Today our economy is growing more slowly than that of almost any other industrial nation in the world. We have more than 4 million unemployed - small businesses are failing at a record rate - and there is poverty and distress on our farms. These are failures of the Republican Party - a party which lacks faith in our capacity to grow - and which has adopted policies designed to protect what we have rather than to add to our abundance. These failures must and will be reversed.', 'And America can find the model for its future growth here in the South. For the most dramatic economic advance of the past decade has been the steady expansion of the modern, vigorous South - the growth of industry - and the steady rise in your standard of living. Today the South is determined to continue that advance - to add to its industry - and restore prosperity to its farms. That is why the South has such a great stake in our desire to build a growing America - for if America grows, the South will also grow - and our programs for developing natural resources, low interest rates, expanding markets, expanding purchasing power, and all the rest are programs which will bring new prosperity, new jobs, and new income to the South, as well as to all America.']","

Today our slowed down economy, our overcrowded schools, our poor and our unemployed, our spreading slums and our thousands of abandoned farms are visible, tangible evidence of our failure to meet those responsibilities. And those failures are defeats for the cause of freedom. For today the Communists are determined to convince the emerging and developing nations of Asia and Africa and Latin America that only communism will eliminate their poverty and hunger and disease - that the Communist road is the only road to a better life. We know that this is not true - for our own greatness is living proof that the road to abundance is freedom's road. And we intend to build a still greater America where every man has a chance to work, a decent house to live in, and decent schools for his children because we believe in a decent life for all our citizens - and because we who first lit man's hope for the good life are determined that freedom shall continue to show the way to progress."", 'Third, we want an America which has a military strength second to none - strength sufficient to convince any enemy that an attack would bring disaster. To do this we need two things: an invulnerable atomic striking force which can survive an enemy attack and still remain in possession of its ability to retaliate, and a modern conventional force of sufficient strength, firepower, and mobility to intervene quickly and effectively to halt Communist aggression in any quarter of the globe. Only when we attain both of these objectives - and our enemies know and respect our strength - can we hope to talk successfully with Mr. Khrushchev about peace.', 'Fourth, we want an America whose qualities of initiative and leadership have earned the respect of the entire free world - not merely because of our size or strength, but because we stand for freedom and progress and the pursuit of peace. This means that we must help the developing and newly emerging nations of the world to achieve the economic progress on which their political freedom depends. We must be sure that they are strong and stable enough to resist the steady and ruthless infiltration of Communist subversion. We must be ready with bold and imaginative new programs to help eliminate poverty and hunger throughout the world.', ""We must also be ready to reassume the initiative in the conduct of our foreign affairs - or act to spread freedom as well as to react against the spread of communism. We must propose new and workable programs for disarmament, for banning nuclear testing, for reducing tensions in the many trouble spots around the world from Berlin to the Formosa Straits. For only an America which is applying its full resources of imagination and thought and strength to the resolution of the world's great problems - only such an America will be able to maintain its position as the champion of peace and the protector of freedom everywhere."", 'These are our goals for America - this is the large and definitive purpose toward which our victory is directed. And if we pursue these goals with energy and determination then the next decade will see a still greater America - an America whose strength is unchallenged.', 'And only a stronger America can hope to maintain its freedom and the freedom of the world. We are faced with an enemy which now commands a vast empire from the Formosa Straits to Berlin - an enemy whose agents of subversion are penetrating into Africa, into Asia, and now stand only 90 miles from our shores in Cuba - an enemy which is convinced of its ultimate victory - which believes, to quote Mr. Khrushchev, ""that the old and the rotten will always fight with the newly emerged, but it is a law of history that the new will always win."" But it is freedom that is new, and despotism and tyranny that is as old as civilization is - and it is freedom that will win - not because of any law of history - but because we will have the strength and the determination that will bring the victory.', 'But to do so we must begin moving again. We must reverse the drift and complacency which has slowed down our growth at home and permitted our prestige and our strength to decline abroad. We must reverse the failures of imagination which have allowed the Russians to be the first on the moon - and the first to return passengers safely from outer space. We must reverse the policies which have confined Mr. Khrushchev to Manhattan - but which have not kept him from moving in Africa and Asia and Latin America.', ""And we cannot do this by trading insults with Mr. Khrushchev or by arguing against his policies - or by talking tough. We talked tough when the people of Hungary revolted - but he crushed the revolt. We talked tough when communism began to grow in Cuba - but Cuba is a Communist satellite today. We have talked tough about the need for disarmament - but the arms race is more intense than ever. We have a magnificent record of talking tough - but we do not have a magnificent record of halting the advance of communism and strengthening the spread of freedom. That will be done through the strength which alone can answer Mr. Khrushchev's threats and ambitions."", 'I come here to North Carolina to set before you the goals for America and to ask you to join with me in rebuilding our strength in leading America across its new frontier. For, as a New Englander, I recognize that the South is still the land of Washington, who made our Nation - of Jefferson, who shaped its direction - and of Robert E. Lee who, after gallant failure, urged those who had followed him in bravery to reunite America in purpose and courage.', 'I cannot assure you that the road ahead is an easy one - because I know it will not be easy, and our journey will require effort and sacrifice. But I believe that the people of this State - and the people of all America - are ready to work together so that American can again begin its forward march. For I believe that we all share the faith of a great son of North Carolina, Thomas Wolfe, when he wrote:', '', '  I think the true discovery of America is before us.', 'I think the true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come.', '', '']","

It means that the product of your labor brings just half of what it brought before the war. It means that no matter how hard you work and how long and how carefully you save, and how much efficiency you apply to your business, you face a steadily diminishing return. As a farm leader said to me, you have been caught like a man in a deep pit, helpless in the grip of forces that are beyond your control. Still, my friends, it has meant that in spite of the maxims that we have learned when we were in school, that we ought to work and save, to be prudent and be temperate, in spite of all of the rest of the homely virtues, the return on these virtues has belied the hopes and the promises on which you and I were raised.', 'That is one of the tragic consequences of this depression. The things that we were taught have not come true. We were taught to work and we have been denied the opportunity to work. We were taught to increase the products of our labor and we have found that while the products increased the return has decreased. We were taught to bring forth the fruits of the earth, and we have found that the fruits of the earth have found no market.', 'The results of our labor, my friends, have been lost in the smash of an economic system that was unable to fulfill its purposes.', 'It is a moral as well as an economic question that we face — moral because we want to reestablish the standards that in times past were our goal. We want the opportunity to live in comfort, reasonable comfort, out of which we may build spiritual values. The consequences of poverty bring a loss of spiritual and moral values. And even more important is the loss of the opportunity that we had hoped to give to the younger generation. We want our children to have a chance for an education, for the sound development of American standards to be applied in their daily lives at play and work. Those opportunities can come only if the condition of agriculture is made more prosperous.', ""Now, the farmer — and when I speak of the farmer I mean not only you who live in the corn belt, but also those in the East or the Northwest who are in the dairy business, those in the South who are raising cotton, and those on the plains who are raising cattle and sheep, and those in the many sections of the country who are raising cattle, all kinds of things, small fruits and big fruits — in other words, the farmer in the broad sense, has been attacked during this past decade simultaneously from two sides. On the one side the farmer's expenses, chiefly in the form of increased taxes, have been going up rather steadily during the past generation, and on the other side, he has been attacked by a constantly depreciating farm dollar during the past twelve years, and it seems to be nothing less than old-fashioned horse sense to seek means to circumvent both of these attacks at the same time. That means, first, for us to seek relief for him from the burden of his expense account and, second, to try to restore the purchasing power of his dollar by getting for him higher prices for the products of the soil.""]","

Roosevelt,Speech2725_10:20,"['Now, those two great purposes are, quite frankly, the basis of my farm policy, and I have definitely connected both of them with the broadest aspects of a new national economy, something that I like to label in simpler words, ""A New Deal,"" covering every part of the Nation, and covering industry and business as well as farming, because I recognize, first of all, that from the soil itself springs our ability to restore our trade with the other Nations of the world.', 'First of all, I want to discuss with you one of the angles of the mounting expenses of agriculture in practically every community and in every State — the problem of the taxes which we have t6 pay.', 'Let us examine the proportion of our expenditures that goes to the various divisions of Government. Half of what you and I pay for the support of Government — in other words, on the average in this country fifty cents out of every dollar — goes to local government, that is, cities, townships, counties and lots of other small units; and the other half, the other fifty cents, goes to the State and Nation.', ""This fifty cents that goes to local government, therefore, points to the necessity for attention to local government. As a broad proposition you and I know we are not using our present agencies of local government with real economy and efficiency. That means we must require our public servants to give a fuller measure of service for what they are paid. It means we must eliminate useless office holders. It means every public official, every employee of local government must determine that he owes it to the country to cooperate in the great purpose of saving the taxpayers' money."", 'But it means more than that, my friends. I am going to speak very frankly to you. There are offices in most States that are provided for in the Constitution and laws of some of the States, offices that have an honorable history but are no longer necessary for the conduct of Government. We have too many tax layers, and it seems to me relief can come only through resolute, courageous cutting.', 'Some of you will ask why I, a candidate for the office of President of the United States, am talking to you about changes in local government. Now, it is perfectly clear that the President has no legal or constitutional control over the local government under which you people live. The President has, nevertheless, my friends, the right and even the duty of taking a moral leadership in this national task because it is a national problem, because in its scope it covers every State, and any problem that is national in this broader sense creates a national moral responsibility in the President of the United States himself.', 'And I propose to use this position of high responsibility to discuss up and down the country, in all seasons and at all times, the duty of reducing taxes, of increasing the efficiency of Government, of cutting out the underbrush around our governmental structure, of getting the most public service for every dollar paid in taxation. That I pledge you, and nothing I have said in the campaign transcends in importance this covenant with the taxpayers of the United States.', 'Now, of the other half dollar of your taxes, it is true that part goes to the support of State Governments. I am not going to discuss that end. In this field also I believe that substantial reductions can be made. While the President rightly has no authority over State budgets, he has the same moral responsibility of national leadership for generally lowered expenses, and therefore for generally lowered taxes.', 'It is in the field of the Federal Government that the office of President can, of course, make itself most directly and definitely felt. Over 30 percent of your tax dollar goes to Washington, and in this field also, immediate reforms can be accomplished. There are, of course, items such as the interest on the public debt which must be paid each year, and which can be reduced only through a reduction in the debt itself, by the creation of a surplus in the place of the present deficit in the national treasury, and it is perhaps worth while that I should tell you that I spent nearly eight years in Washington during the Administration of Woodrow Wilson, and that during those eight years I had a fair understanding of the problem of the national expenses, and that I knew at first hand many of the details of actual administration of the different departments. Later in this campaign I propose to analyze the enormous increase in the growth of what you and I call bureaucracy. We are not getting an adequate return for the money we are spending in Washington, or to put it another way, we are spending altogether too much money for Government services that are neither practical nor necessary. And then, in addition to that, we are attempting too many functions. We need to simplify what the Federal Government is giving to the people.', 'I accuse the present Administration of being the greatest spending Administration in peace times in all our history. It is an Administration that has piled bureau on bureau, commission on commission, and has failed to anticipate the dire needs and the reduced earning power of the people. Bureaus and bureaucrats, commissions and commissioners have been retained at the expense of the taxpayer.']","

Franklin D. Roosevelt,Speech2725_20:30,"['Now, I read in the past few days in the newspapers that the President is at work on a plan to consolidate and simplify the Federal bureaucracy. My friends, four long years ago, in the campaign of 1928, he, as a candidate, proposed to do this same thing. And today, once more a candidate, he is still proposing, and I leave you to draw your own inferences.', 'And on my part I ask you very simply to assign to me the task of reducing the annual operating expenses of your national Government.', ""Now I come to the other half of the farmer's problem, the increase of the purchasing power of the farm dollar. I have already gone at length into the emergency proposals relating to our major crops, and now I want to discuss in more detail a very important factor, a thing known as the tariff, and our economic relationship to the rest of this big round world."", 'From the beginning of our Government, one of the most difficult questions in our economic life has been the tariff. But it is a fact that it is now so interwoven with our whole economic structure, and that structure is such an intricate and delicate pattern of causes and effects, that tariff revision must be undertaken, without question, with scrupulous care and only on the basis of established facts.', 'I have to go back in history a little way. In the course of his 1928 campaign, the present Republican candidate for President with great boldness laid down the propositions that high tariffs interfere only slightly, if at all, with our export or our import trade, that they are necessary to the success of agriculture and afford essential farm relief; that they do not interfere with the payments of debts by other Nations to us, and that they are absolutely necessary to the economic formula which he proposed at that time as the road to the abolition of poverty. And I must pause here for a moment to observe that the experience of the past four years has unhappily demonstrated the error, the gross, fundamental, basic error of every single one of those propositions — but four years ago! — that every one of them has been one of the effective causes of the present depression; and finally that no substantial progress toward recovery from this depression, either here or abroad, can be had without a forthright recognition of those errors.', 'And so I am asking effective action to reverse the disastrous policies which were based on them. As I have elsewhere remarked, the 1928 Republican leadership prosperity promise was based on the assertion that although our agriculture was producing a surplus far in excess of our power to consume, and that, due to the mass and automatic machine production of today, our industrial production had also passed far beyond the point of domestic consumption, nevertheless, we should press forward to increase industrial production as the only means of maintaining prosperity and employment. And the candidate of that year insisted that, although we could not consume all those things at home, there was some kind of unlimited market for our rapidly increasing surplus in export trade, and he boldly asserted that on this theory we were on the verge of the greatest commercial expansion in history. I do not have to tell you the later history of that.', 'And then, in the spring of 1929, ostensibly for the purpose of enacting legislation for the relief of agriculture, a special session of Congress was called, and the disastrous fruit of that session was the notorious and indefensible Grundy-Smoot-Hawley tariff. As to the much-heralded purpose of that special session for the relief of agriculture, the result, my friends, was a ghastly jest. The principal cash crops of our farms are produced much in excess of our domestic requirements. And we know that no tariff on a surplus crop, no matter how high the wall —1,000 percent, if you like — has the slightest effect on raising the domestic price of that crop. Why, the producers of all those crops are as effectively thrust outside the protection of our tariff walls as if there were no tariff at all. But we still know that the tariff does protect the price of industrial products and raises them above world prices, as the farmer with increasing bitterness has come to realize. He sells on a free trade basis; he buys in a protected market. The higher industrial tariffs go, my friends, the greater is the burden of the farmer.', 'Now, the first effect of the Grundy tariff was to increase or sustain the cost of all that agriculture buys, but the harm to our whole farm population did not stop there.', 'The destructive effect of the Grundy tariff on export markets has not been confined to agriculture. It has ruined our export trade in industrial products as well. Industry, with its foreign trade cut off, naturally began to look to the home market a market supplied for the greater part by the purchasing power of farm families — but for reasons that you and I know, when industry turned its eye to the American market, it found that the Grundy tariff had reduced the buying power of the farmer.', 'So what happened? Deprived of any American market, the other industrial Nations in order to support their own industries, and take care of their own employment problem, had to find new outlets. In that quest they took to trade agreements with other countries than ourselves and also to the preservation of their own domestic markets against importations by trade restrictions of all kinds. An almost frantic movement toward self-contained nationalism began among other Nations of the world, and of course the direct result was a series of retaliatory and defensive measures on their part, in the shape of tariffs and embargoes and import quotas and international arrangements. Almost immediately international commerce began to languish. The export markets for our industrial and agricultural surpluses began to disappear altogether.']","

Franklin D. Roosevelt,Speech2725_30:40,"['In the year 1929, a year before the enactment of the Grundy tariff, we exported 54.8 percent of all the cotton produced in the United States — more than one-half. That means, Mr. Cotton Grower, that in 1929 every other row of your cotton was sold abroad. And you, the growers of wheat, exported 17 percent of your wheat, but your great foreign market has been largely sacrificed; and so, with the grower of rye, who was able to dispose of 20 percent of his crop to foreign markets. The grower of leaf-tobacco had a stake of 41 percent of his income overseas, and one-third of the lard production, 33 percent, was exported in the year 1929. Where does that come in? Well, it concerns the corn grower because some of us, even from the East, know that corn is exported in the shape of lard.', 'How were your interests taken care of? Oh, they gave you a tariff on corn — chicken feed — literally and figuratively, but those figures show how vitally you are interested in the preservation, perhaps I had better say the return, of our export trade.', 'Now, the ink on the Hawley-Smoot-Grundy tariff bill was hardly dry before foreign Nations commenced their program of retaliation. Brick for brick they built their walls against us. They learned the lesson from us. The villainy we taught them they practiced on us.', 'And the Administration in Washington had reason to know that would happen. It was warned. While the bill was before Congress, our State Department received 16o protests from 33 other Nations, many of whom after the passage of the bill erected their own tariff walls to the detriment or destruction of much of our export trade.', 'Well, what is the result? In two years, from 1930 to May, 1932, to escape the penalty on the introduction of American-made goods, American manufacturers have established in foreign countries 258 separate factories; 48 of them in Europe; 12 in Latin America; 28 in the Far East, and 71 across the border in Canada. The Prime Minister of Canada said in a recent speech that a factory is moving every day of the year from the United States into Canada, and he assured those at the recent conferences at Ottawa that the arrangements made there with Great Britain and other colonies would take $250,000,000 of Canadian trade that would otherwise go to the United States. So you see, my friends, what that tariff bill did there to put more men on the street here, and to put more people to work outside our borders.', 'Now, there was a secondary and perhaps even more disastrous effect of Grundyism. Billions of dollars of debts are due to this country from abroad. If the debtor Nations cannot export goods, they must try to pay in gold. But we started such a drain on the gold reserves of the other Nations as to force practically all of them off the gold standard. What happened? The value of the money of each of these countries relative to the value of our dollar declined alarmingly and steadily. It took more Argentine pesos to buy an American plow. It took more English shillings to buy an American bushel of wheat, or an American bale of cotton.', 'Why, they just could not buy our goods with their money. These goods then were thrown back upon our markets and prices fell still more.', 'And so, summing up, this Grundy tariff has largely extinguished the export markets for our industrial and our farm surplus; it has prevented the payment of public and private debts to us and the interest thereon, increasing taxation to meet the expense of our Government, and finally it has driven our factories abroad.', 'The process still goes on, my friends. Indeed, it may be only in its beginning. The Grundy tariff still retains its grip on the throat of international commerce.', 'There is no relief in sight, and certainly there can be no relief if the men in Washington responsible for this disaster continue in power. And I say to you, in all earnestness and sincerity, that unless and until this process is reversed throughout the world, there is no hope for full economic recovery, or for true prosperity in this beloved country of ours.']","

Franklin D. Roosevelt,Speech2725_40:56,"['The essential trouble is that the Republican leaders thought they had a good patent on the doctrine of unscalable tariff walls and that no other Nation could use the same idea. Well, either that patent has expired or else never was any good anyway; or else, one other alternative, all the other Nations have infringed on our patent and there is no court to which we can take our case. It was a stupid, blundering idea, and we know it today and we know it has brought disaster.', 'Do not expect our adroit Republican friends to admit this. They do not. On the contrary, they have adopted the boldest alibi in the history of politics. Having brought this trouble on the world, they now seek to avoid all responsibility by blaming the foreign victims for their own economic blundering. They say that all of our troubles come from abroad and that the Administration is not in the least to be held to answer. This excuse is a classic of impertinence. If ever a condition was more clearly traceable to two specific American-made causes, it is the depression of this country and the world. Those two causes are interrelated. The second one, in point of time, is the Grundy tariff. The first one is the fact that by improvident loans to ""backward and crippled countries,"" the policy of which was specifically recommended by the President, we financed practically our entire export trade and the payment of interest and principal to us by our debtors, and even in part, the payment of German reparations.', 'When we began to diminish that financing in 1929 the economic structure of the world began to totter.', 'If it be fair to ask, What does the Democratic Party propose to do in the premises?', 'The platform declares in favor of a competitive tariff which means one which will put the American producers on a market equality with their foreign competitors, one that equalizes the difference in the cost of production, not a prohibitory tariff back of which domestic producers may combine to practice extortion on the American public.', 'I appreciate that the doctrine thus announced is not widely different from that preached by Republican statesmen and politicians, but I do know this, that the theory professed by them is that the tariff should equalize the difference in the cost of production as between this country and competitive countries, and I know that in practice that theory is utterly disregarded. The rates that are imposed are far in excess of any such difference, looking to the total exclusion of imports in other words, prohibitory rates.', 'Of course the outrageously excessive rates in that bill as it became law, must come down. But we should not lower them beyond a reasonable point, a point indicated by common sense and facts. Such revision of the tariff will injure no legitimate interest. Labor need have no apprehensions concerning such a course, for labor knows by long and bitter experience that the highly protected industries pay not one penny higher wages than the non-protected industries, such as the automobile industry, for example.', 'But, my friends, how is reduction to be accomplished? In view of present world conditions, international negotiation is the first, the most practical, the most common-sense, and the most desirable method. We must consent to the reduction to some extent of some of our duties in order to secure a lowering of foreign tariff walls over which a larger measure of our surplus may be sent.', 'I have not the fear that possesses some timorous minds that we should get the worst of it in such reciprocal arrangements. I ask if you have no faith in our Yankee tradition of good old-fashioned trading? Do you believe that our early instincts for successful barter have degenerated or atrophied? I do not think so. I have confidence that the spirit of the stalwart traders still permeates our people, that the red blood of the men who sailed our Yankee clipper ships around the Horn and Cape of Good Hope in the China trade still courses in our veins. I cannot picture Uncle Sam as a supine, white-livered, flabby-muscled old man, cooling his heels in the shade of our tariff walls. We may not have the astuteness in some forms of international diplomacy that our more experienced European friends have, but when it comes to good old-fashioned barter and trade —whether it be goods or tariff — my money is on the American. My friends, there cannot and shall not be any foreign dictation of our tariff policies, but I am willing and ready to sit down around the table with them.', 'And next, my friends, the Democrats propose to accomplish the necessary reduction through the agency of the Tariff Commission.', ""I need not say to you that one of the most deplorable features of tariff legislation is the log-rolling process by which it has been effected in Republican and Democratic Congresses. Indefensible rates are introduced through an understanding, usually implied rather than expressed among members, each of whom is interested in one or more individual items. Yes, it is a case of you scratch my back and I will scratch yours. Now, to avoid that as well as other evils in tariff making, a Democratic Congress in 1916 passed, and a Democratic President approved, a bill creating the bipartisan' Tariff Commission, charged with the duty of supplying the Congress with accurate and full information upon which to base tariff rates. That Commission functioned as a scientific body until 1922, when by the incorporation of the so-called flexible provisions of the Act it was transformed into a political body. Under those flexible provisions —reenacted in the Grundy tariff of 1930 — the Commission reports not to a Congress but to the President, who is then empowered on its recommendation to raise or lower the tariff rates by as much as 5o percent. At the last session of Congress — this brings us down to date — by the practically unanimous action of the Democrats of both houses, aided by liberal-minded Republicans led by Senator Norris, of Nebraska, a bill was passed by the Congress, but vetoed by the President, which, for the purpose of preventing log-rolling, provided that if a report were made by the Tariff Commission on a particular item, with a recommendation as to the rates of duty, a bill to make effective that rate would not be subject to amendment in the Congress so as to include any other item not directly affected by the change proposed in the bill. And in that way each particular tariff rate proposed would be judged on its merits alone. If that bill had been signed by the President of the United States, log-rolling would have come to an end."", 'I am confident in the belief that under such a system rates adopted would generally be so reasonable that there would be very little opportunity for criticism or even caviling as to them. I am sure that it is not that any duties are imposed that complaint is made, for despite the effort, repeated in every campaign, to stigmatize the Democratic Party as a free trade party, there never has been a tariff act passed since the Government came into existence, in which the duties were not levied with a view to giving the American producer an advantage over his foreign competitor. I think you will agree with me that the difference in our day between the two major parties in respect to their leadership on the subject of the tariff is that the Republican leaders, whatever may be their profession, would put the duties so high as to make them practically prohibitive — and on the other hand that the Democratic leaders would put them as low as the preservation of the prosperity of American industry and American agriculture will permit.', 'Another feature of the bill to which reference has been made, a feature designed to obviate tariff log-rolling, contemplated the appointment of a public counsel who should be heard on all applications for changes in rates whether for increases sought by producers, sometimes greedy producers, or for decreases asked by importers, equally often actuated by purely selfish motives. And I hope some such change may speedily be enacted. It will have my cordial approval because, my friends, it means that the average citizen would have some representation.', 'Now, just a few words in closing. I want to speak to you of one other factor which enters into the dangerous emergency in which you farmers find yourselves at this moment. For more than a year I have spoken in my State and in other States of the actual calamity that impends on account of farm mortgages. Ever since my nomination on the first day of July, I have advocated immediate attention and immediate action looking to the preservation of the American home to the American farmer. But I recognize that I am not at the head of the national Administration nor shall I be until March 4th next. Today I read in the papers that for the first time, so far as I know, the Administration of President Hoover has discovered the fact that there is such a thing as a farm mortgage or a home mortgage.', 'I do not have to tell you that, with the knowledge of conditions in my State which ranks fifth or sixth among the agricultural States of the Union and with the knowledge I have gleaned on this trip from coast to coast, I realize to the full the seriousness of the farm mortgage situation. And at least we can take a crumb of hope from his proposal for just another conference, a conference of some kind at least to discuss the situation. Seriously, my friends, all that I can tell you is that with you I deplore, I regret the inexcusable, the reprehensible delay of Washington, not for months alone, but for years. I have already been specific on this subject, upon mortgages, in my Topeka speech. All that I can promise you between now and the fourth of March is that I will continue to preach the plight of the farmer who is losing his home. All I can do is to promise you that when the authority of administration and recommendation to Congress is placed in my hands I will do everything in my power to bring the relief that is so long overdue.

AH that can be done is to treat this as one incidental evil of a great expansive movement in the material progress of the world and to make sure that there will be no recurrence of such evil. In this regard we have made great progress and reform, as in respect to secret rebates in railways, the improper conferring of public franchises, and the immunity of monopolizing trusts and combinations.* The misfortunes of ordinary business, the division of the estates of wealthy men at their death, the chances of speculation which undue good fortune seems often to stimulate, operating as causes through a generation, will do much to divide up such large fortunes.\xa0 It is far \xa0better to await the diminution of this evil by natural causes than to attempt what would soon take on the aspect of confiscation or to abolish the principle and institution of private property and to change to socialism. Socialism involves the taking away of the motive for acquisition, saving, energy, and enterprise, and a futile attempt by committees to apportion the rewards due for productive labor. It means stagnation and retrogression. It destroys the mainspring of human action that has carried the world on and upward for 2,000 years.', 'I do not say that the two gentlemen who now lead, one the Democratic party and the other the former Republicans who have left their party, in their attacks upon existing conditions, and in their attempt to satisfy the popular unrest by promises of remedies, are consciously embracing socialism. The truth is that they do not offer any definite legislation or policy by which the happy conditions they promise are to be brought about, but if their promises mean anything, they lead directly toward the appropriation of what belongs to one man, to another. The truth is, my friends, both those who have left the Republican party under the inspiration of their present leader, and our old opponents, the Democrats, under their candidate, are going in a direction they do not definitely know, toward an end they can not definitely describe, with but one chief and clear object, and that is of acquiring power for their party by popular support through the promise of a change for the better.', ""What they clamor for is a change. They ask for a change in government so that the government may be restored to the people, as if this had not been a people's government since the beginning of the Constitution. I have the fullest sympathy with every reform in governmental and election machinery which shall facilitate the expression of the popular will as the short ballot and the reduction in the number of elective offices to make it possible. But these gentlemen propose to reform the government, whose present defects, if any, are due to the failure of the people to devote as much time as is necessary to their political duties, by requiring a political activity by the people three times that which thus far the people have been willing to assume; and thus their remedies, instead of exciting the people to further interest and activity in the government, will tire them into such an indifference as still further to remand control of public affairs to a minority."", 'But after we have changed all the governmental machinery so as to permit instantaneous expression of the people in constitutional amendments, in statutes, and in recall of public agents, what then? Votes are not bread, constitutional amendments are not work, referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses, recalls do not furnish clothing, initiatives do not supply employment or relieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity. We still ought to have set before us the definite plans to bring on complete equality of opportunity and to abolish hardship and evil for humanity. We listen for them in vain.']","

William Howard Taft,Speech2738_30:40,"[""Instead of giving us the benefit of any specific remedies for the hardships and evils of society they point out, they follow their urgent appeals for closer association of the people in legislation by an attempt to cultivate the hostility of the people to the courts and to represent that they are in some form upholding injustice and are obstructing the popular will. Attempts are made to take away all those safeguards for maintaining the independence of the judiciary which are so carefully framed in our Constitution. These attempts find expression in the policy, on the one hand, of the recall of judges, a system under which a judge whose decision in one case may temporarily displease the electorate is to be deprived at once of his office by a popular vote, a pernicious system embodied in the Arizona constitution and which the Democrats of the House and Senate refused to condemn as the initial policy of a new State. The same spirit manifested itself in the vote by Democratic Senators on the proposition, first, to abolish the Commerce Court, and, second, to abolish judges by mere act of repeal, although under the Constitution their terms are for life, on no ground except that they did not like some of the court's recent decisions. Another form of hostility to the judiciary is shown in the grotesque proposition by the leader of the former Republicans who have left their party, for a recall of decisions, so that a decision on a point of constitutional law, having been rendered by the highest court capable of rendering it, shall then be submitted to popular vote to determine whether it ought to be sustained. Again, the Democratic party in Congress and convention shows its desire to weaken the courts by forbidding the use of the writ of injunction to protect a lawful business against the destructive effect of a secondary boycott and by interposing a jury in contempt proceedings brought to enforce the court's order and decrees. These provisions are really class legislation designed to secure immunity for lawlessness in labor disputes on the part of the laborers, but operating much more widely to paralyze the arm of the court in cases which do not involve labor disputes at all. The hostility to the judiciary and the measures to take away its power and its independence constitute the chief definite policy that can be fairly attributed to that class of statesmen and reformers whose control the Republican party escaped at Chicago and to whom the Democratic party yielded at Baltimore."", 'The Republican party stands for none of these innovations. It refuses to make changes simply for the purpose of making a change, and cultivating popular hope that in the change something beneficial, undefined, will take place. It does not believe that human nature has * changed. It still believes it is possible in this world that the fruits of energy, courage, enterprise, attention to duty, hard work, thrift, providence, restraint of appetite and of passions will continue to have their reward under our present system, and that laziness, lack of attention, lack of industry, the yielding to appetite and passion, carelessness, dishonesty, and disloyalty will ultimately find their own punishment in the world here. We do not deny that there are exceptions, and that seeming fortune follows wickedness and misfortune virtue, but, on the whole, we are optimists and believe that the rule is the other way. We do not know any way to avoid human injustice but to perfect our laws for administering justice, to develop the morality of the individual, to give direct supervision and aid to those who are, or are likely to be, oppressed, and to give as full scope as possible to individual effort and its rewards. Wherever we can see that a statute which does not deprive any person or class of what is his is going to help many people, we are in favor of it. We favor the greatest good to the greatest number, but we do not believe that this can be accomplished by minimizing the rewards of individual effort, or by infringing or destroying the right of property, which, next to the right of liberty, has been and is the greatest civilizing institution in history. In other words, the Republican party believes in progress along the lines upon which we have attained progress already. We do not believe that we can reach a millennium by a sudden change in all our existing institutions. We believe that we have made progress from the beginning until now, and that the progress is to continue into the far future; that it is reasonable progress that experience has shown to be really useful and helpful, and from which there is no reaction to something worse.', 'The Republican party stands for the Constitution as it is, with such amendments adopted according to its provisions as new conditions thoroughly understood may require. We believe that it has stood the test of time, and that there have been disclosed really no serious defects in its operation.', 'It is said this is not an issue in the campaign. It seems to me it is the supreme issue. The Democratic party and the former Republicans who have left their party are neither of them to be trusted on this subject, as I have shown. The Republican party is the nucleus of that public opinion which favors constant progress and development along safe and sane lines and under the Constitution as we have had it for more than one hundred years, and which believes in the maintenance of an independent judiciary as the keystone of our liberties and the balance wheel by which the whole governmental machinery is kept within the original plan.', 'WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE.', 'The normal and logical question which ought to be asked and answered in determining whether an administration should be continued in power is, How has the government been administered? Has it been economical and efficient? Has it aided or obstructed business prosperity? Has it made for progress in bettering the condition of the people and especially of the wage earner? Ought its general policies to approve themselves to the people?', 'During this administration we have given special attention to the machinery of government with a view to increasing its efficiency and reducing its cost. For twenty years there has been a continuous expansion in every direction of the governmental functions and a necessary increase in the civil and military servants by which these functions are performed. The expenditures of the government have normally increased from year to year on an average of nearly 4 per cent. There never has been a systematic investigation and reorganization of this governmental structure with a view to eliminating duplications, to uniting bureaus where union is possible and more effective, and to making the whole organization more compact and its parts more closely co-ordinated. As a beginning, we examined closely the estimates. These, unless watched, grow from year to year under the natural tendency of the bureau chiefs. The first estimates which were presented to us we cut some $50,000,000, and this policy we have maintained through the administration and have prevented the normal annual increase in government expenditures, so the result is that the deficit of $58,735,000, which we', 'found on the 1st of July, 1909, was changed on the 1st of July, 1910, by increase of the revenues under the Payne law, including the corporation tax, to a surplus of $15,806,000; on July 1, 1911, to a surplus of $47,234,000, and on July 1, 1912, to a surplus of $36,336,000. The expenditures for 1909 were $662,324,000; for 1910, $659,705,000; for 1911, $654,138,000, and for 1912, $654,804,000. These figures of surplus and expenditure do not include any receipts or expenditures on account of the Panama Canal.', 'I secured an appropriation for the appointment of an Economy and Efficiency Commission, consisting of the ablest experts in the country, and they have been working for two years on the question of how the government departments may be reorganized and what changes can be made with a view to giving it greater effectiveness for governmental purposes on the one hand and securing this at considerably less cost on the other. I have transmitted to Congress from time to time the recommendations of this commission, and while they can not all be adopted at one session, and while their recommendations have not been rounded and complete because of the necessity for taking greater time, I think that the Democratic Appropriations Committee of the House has become convinced that we are on the right- road and that substantial reform may be effected through the adoption of most of the plans recommended by this commission.', 'PANAMA CANAL.']","

In order that our influence might be useful, we have acted with the other great powers, and we have exercised our influence effectively toward the strengthening of the popular movement and giving the Republic governmental stability. We have lent our good offices in the negotiation of a loan essential to the continuance of the Republic and which we hope that China will accept under such conditions of supervision as are adequate to the security of the lenders and at the same time will be of great assistance to those in whose behalf the loan is made, the people of China.', 'Our Mexican neighbor on the south has been disturbed by two revolutions, and these have necessarily brought a strain upon our relations because of the losses sustained by American citizens, both in property and in life, due to the lawlessness which could not be prevented under conditions of civil war. The pressure for intervention at times has been great, and grounds upon which, it is said, we might have intervened have been urged upon us, but this administration has been conscious that one hostile step in intervention and the passing of the border by one regiment of troops would mean war with Mexico, the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, the loss of thousands of lives in the tranquillization of that country, with all the subsequent problems that would arise as to its disposition after we found ourselves in complete armed possession.', 'In order to avoid the plain consequences, it seemed the course of patriotism and of wisdom to subject ourselves and our citizens to some degree of suffering and inconvenience and to pass over with a strong protest and a claim for damages even those injuries inflicted on our peaceful citizens in our own territory along the border by flying bullets in engagements between the governmental and the revolutionary forces on the Mexican side. It is easy to arouse popular indignation over an instance of this character. It is easy to take advantage of it for the purpose of justifying aggressive action, and it is easy to cultivate political support and popularity by a warlike and truculent policy, but with the familiarity that we have had in the carrying on of such a war in the Philippines and in Cuba, no one with a sense of responsibility to the American people would involve them in the almost unending burden and thankless task of enforcing peace upon these 15,000,000 of people fighting among themselves, when they would necessarily all turn against us at the first manifestation of our purpose to intervene. I am very sure that the course of self-restraint that the administration has pursued in respect to Mexico will vindicate itself in the pages of history.', 'I am hopeful that the present government is now rapidly subduing the insurrection and that we may look for tranquillity [sic] near at hand. The demonstration of force which I felt compelled to make in the early part of the disturbance, by the mobilization of some 15,000 or 20,000 troops in Texas, and holding maneuvers there, had a good and direct effect and, as our ambassador and consuls report, secured much increased respect for American and other foreign property in the disturbances that followed. Similar questions have arisen in Cuba, but we have been able to avoid intervention, and to aid and encourage that young Republic by suggestion and advice.', 'I am glad to believe that we have had more peace in the Central American Republics because of our attention to their needs and our activity in mediating between them than ever before in the history of those Republics.']","

Under two Democratic administrations, we achieved the following:  banning of nuclear weapons tests in air, in space and underwater; an end to the poisoning of the atmosphere by the major nuclear powers; the preservation of outer space free from nuclear weapons; the quarantining of Latin America against atomic arms.', '\tIn addition, we are continuing our efforts to ban all tests of nuclear weapons, even those underground, and to halt the production of fissionable material for use in nuclear weapons.', '\tToday we have an opportunity to take a further step--a crucial step--to halt the spread of nuclear terror.  A treaty--a nonproliferation treaty--is before the Senate of the United States, awaiting ratification.  I say we should not delay one day in stopping the spread of nuclear arms.

Because of Mr. Nixon's position as the leader of the Republican party, it is within his power to insure the ratification of this treaty.  A delay has occurred.

Through these talks--when final arrangements for them are completed--we will seek to avoid a situation in which we and the Soviets would be forced to devote more and more of badly needed resources to the strategic arms race.

Neither side can attack the other without being destroyed in return.  The placing of nuclear missiles in submarines under the sea and in concrete silos deep underground has removed the advantage to a would-be aggressor of striking first.  The price of nuclear aggression therefore is suicide.  There is no reliable defense, no place to hide.  This grim confrontation underlies the balance of terror; but on it rests the peace of the world today.', '\tFurther accumulation on both sides borders on insanity.  It is not needed to deter; it does not provide more protection; it does not ensure greater destructive capability.  It can, however, mislead a would-be aggressor into calculating erroneously that he is temporarily stronger; it can tempt him into risky confrontations; it can stimulate mutual insecurity and suspicion.  It is as useless as it is irrational.', '\tBut Americans are not insane.  We are rational, creative and determined to control our fate.

Let the Soviet Union know that the provisions of the United Nations Charter cannot be used as a pretext to justify threats to the security of a NATO ally.', '\tLet us remember that critical decisions concerning the test ban negotiations took place during the period when the Cold War was building to its zenith in the Cuban missile crisis.  In the aftermath of Cuba came the hot line and, a few months later, the signature of the Limited Test Ban Treaty.', ""\tBoth the danger and the cost of the arms race are astronomical.  Today, the military budgets of all the nations of the world are approaching more than $200 billion.  This year, the U.S. military budget alone is over $80 billion.

Let us see what kind of a world we can build looking to the future.', '\tLet me tell you why, for example, the arms control agreement that we have reached with the Soviet Union, important as it was, is only a beginning.  It was a limited agreement.  We announced just a few days ago that we are going to have more negotiations in November with the Soviet Union for the limitation on all offensive nuclear weapons, as well as defensive weapons.

You may have seen in the papers pictures in the Oval Office at the White House that no one even a year ago would have dreamed would have been possible.  Fifteen doctors from the People's Republic of China were there.  Two were women, twelve were men.  Another was a specialist in a certain area of science related to medicine.  We discussed what they had come to America for.  I do not suggest that because fifteen Chinese doctors from the Communist People's Republic of China have visited the United States that this means we are going to have instant peace and no disagreement between two countries with entirely different philosophies and with many differences in interests.

We know it is not easy, but I have determined that whatever money is required will be spent for this, and we are working on it.  And he said, ""Wouldn\'t it be a very fine thing for both countries if our doctors could work together, not separately, to try to find the cure for this disease?""', '\tThen I pointed out to him something that may be even surprising to you, unless you have suffered from this dread disease in your own family.  More people died of cancer in the United States last year than the United States lost in killed in action in all of World War II.  Now, what I am saying is this: I say that an initiative that will have Russian doctors and Chinese doctors and American doctors working together is good, because the genius that will find the answer to that dread disease and other diseases, it may not be in America, it may be in Russia, it may be in China, it may be in Latin America.  But you can be sure we now have started on the road to get the doctors of the world, regardless of philosophy, working together on this dread disease, rather than against each other.', ""\tNow, in order to continue to make progress in making this a safer world, a safer world when the two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, will negotiate rather than confront each other, will limit their arms rather than engage in an arms race, in order also to make this a safer world so that the people, one-fourth of all the people of the world who live in the People's Republic of China can cooperate in some areas with the United States, let me just tell you my philosophy."", '\tI know what the great danger is that hangs over the world: the danger of nuclear war.

I pledge to you, we shall keep the United States in a position second to none in its national defense, because we know we will use it for peace.', '\tIf, also, the United States is to be able to play this role, a role in which we are building peace for all the world, which I know all Americans want us to do, it is also essential that we develop within our armed forces the kind of spirit, the kind of volunteerism which we will need, because, as you know, one of the great accomplishments of this administration which has been little noticed, except among those who might be of draft age, is that in June of next year we move away from the draft to the all-volunteer army.']",NA,1972,reject,FALSE,548

I believe in respecting the uniform of those who defend the United States.', ""\tThis is Veterans Day.  I have just motorcaded all through Westchester.  I have seen the great bands that are here.  I have heard the patriotic songs.  At Eastchester I laid the first wreath at the new War Memorial that had been erected there.

That means that with peace you want jobs.  What we want is something we have not had since President Eisenhower was president in '55 and '56.

But that isn't good enough.  We must continue to hold the line on prices.  If we are going to continue to have growth in our economy, we must stop that kind of spending that would lead to a tax increase in this country, because taxes are already too high and we are going to keep those taxes from going up."", ""\tIf we are going to continue to have progress, progress that will mean more jobs for more Americans than ever before in history, we must provide, of course, every kind of assistance that we possibly can to those that cannot help themselves, but there must be no ceiling on opportunity in America, no ceiling by quota or any other way.  Let a man or woman, regardless of his background, go as high as he can.  That is the way to build a great economy in America.  And while I am talking on that subject, if we are going to continue to have this economy grow and expand, to provide the new jobs that we want, let's understand that there is no real conflict when we talk about welfare versus work.  Let us understand: every American wants to provide welfare to the greatest extent possible to those who cannot help themselves.  But let us also understand: except for the taxes paid by 82 million Americans who work, there would be no welfare in the United States, so we must not penalize those who work."", '\tI would suggest tonight an Eleventh Commandment: no one who is able to work shall find it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work.

As I have gone through Westchester and now tonight, I have seen many men in blue, the uniforms of the police.  Give them the backing and the respect they deserve for the job that they do.', '\tOn my part, I will say to you that any appointments that I have the opportunity to make to the courts of this land or to the law enforcement officials of this land, as has been the case in the last four years, you can be sure that the age of permissiveness is gone.

It is not just enough to have peace.  It is not just enough to have a job.  You must have a goal.  That means you want this country to be better.  You want it to progress.  Let me tell you that in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, in the field of environment, we laid before the Congress in 1970, again in 1971, and early this year, 1972, as Governor Rockefeller will agree, historic new programs of reform.  They are needed.  The Congress has not acted.

I believe that we can be and should be certainly the strongest nation in the world.  I believe that without question we will be the richest nation in the world.  But we would still possibly not be a great people unless we had something else.', '\tLet me take you back 196 years.  There in Independence Hall the thought ran through my mind, what a wonderful country it was so many years ago, and yet it was weak and it was poor, only 3 million people and 13 states.

It had an ideal and because its people so loved this country, that ideal caught the imagination of the world, and America, from the time of its beginning, has been the hope of the world.', '\tI just want to say to you, I have been to eighty countries.

Today we have a new breed of malefactors:  the malefactors of great power, bred and nourished by the excesses of big government.  Theodore Roosevelt's remedy for the excesses of big business was called trust busting.  Trust busting was a process of decentralization whereby big business was brought within reach of the people and the vested interests of big business made subject to the interests of the people.  But government is in need of the same treatment; the same decentralizing process that will bring government within reach of the people and make its vast octopus of vested interests subject to the people's interests."", ""\tThe fourth thing required of us for good government is to unify; to make the whole government a cooperative enterprise for the whole people's benefit."", ""\tThat means, first of all, unity--a working partnership in the executive branch of the government, itself, today, too often, the left hand of our government has no idea what the right hand is doing and neither hand can be relied on.

First of all let me say that the American people plainly will have a decision Tuesday about whether or not to fundamentally overhaul the system by which we finance health care, control health care costs, and provide basic health care to all of our people.', '\tToday in America health care costs too much--30 percent more of our income than any country on Earth. Much of it is going to things that have nothing to do with how healthy we are--to insurance, to administrative costs, to federal regulations, to unnecessary procedures, to the practice of defensive medicine, to the absence of basic primary and preventive health care.', '\tThis is weakening our economy. It is exploding the budget deficit. Our system, in spite of all of its costs, covers too few people and interestingly enough, since Mr. Bush has been president, about 100,000 Americans a month have lost their health insurance. The system is fundamentally broken and we need to fix it.', '\tI have outlined a program to control costs and to provide affordable health care to all Americans, which a recent bipartisan commission says will save the average family $1,200 a year more than the Bush plan by the year 2000, will cover all Americans, while his will leave 27 million behind and will, in the next dozen years, free up over $2 trillion to reinvest in our economy.', ""\tBut there are things that even this health care program alone cannot address. And I want to talk about one of them especially tonight--the issue of AIDS. But before I do, let me say that there are other things that we ought to face, too. We have, for example, for too long ignored women's health issues. We know they haven't gotten the attention or the funding they need. And it's time we had a president who would work with Congress with a real commitment to fight breast cancer and ovarian cancer with the same vigor with which we have fought other diseases."", ""\tI was deeply dismayed when Mr. Bush vetoed the Women's Health Care Bill earlier this year, under pressure from the extreme elements of the Republican party who are anti-choice because of the fetal tissue research issue. That research opportunity offers us the best chance that we have to deal with issues like diabetes. But the core of this administration's commitment to women's health was sadly lacking, and if elected on Tuesday, I will give that core back to American health policy."", '\tI want to begin the discussion of the AIDS issue in a cold-hearted way and deal then with the more emotional aspects.', '\tEverything I hope to save with an American health care system that preserves the best of what we do well--the best research, the best private medical care, a private system of insurance reorganized to cut costs and provide health care--all of these savings could be eaten up by the exploding costs of dealing with this epidemic unless we finally, as a people, face our common responsibilities.']",NA,1992,reject,FALSE,567

AIDS can strike anyone--and it does.', '\tWhen I think of all the experiences I have had in this long and difficult and challenging race for president, perhaps the most moving have been the personal encounters with people who have been affected by AIDS. I remember meeting a doctor in Texas, an attractive young woman in her late thirties, who devoted herself to dealing with AIDS patients and got the HIV virus because the needle with which she had just given an inoculation had its cap pop off just at the moment she was putting it into the wastepaper can, and it pricked her. The prick of the needle on her fingertip made her HIV-positive. And yet she was still working with AIDS patients, determined to live on and work on.', ""\tI remember a town meeting I had in Michigan, like the one we're going to in New Jersey tonight, where a young couple stood up and the woman was in tears and I thought they were going to talk about losing their jobs or their health insurance--and the young wife said that she was HIV-positive. And thank God, they had a normal child.

I remember being in colonial Williamsburg, the seat of much of our country's history, preparing for the debate in Richmond, when a grandmother came up to me with tears in her eyes to tell me that both her daughter and her granddaughter had died of AIDS."", '\tI remember most vividly being in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in front of the Quaker Oats building in an unusual situation where I was being demonstrated against in the back of the crowd by pro-life forces. And I came up to a woman with a pro-choice sticker on, and she had a child of another race in her arms. And I said, ""Tell me about this baby. Where did you get this baby?"" And she beamed, she smiled, she said, ""This is my baby. This baby was adopted from another state, and she has AIDS.

This city has the sixth-highest rate of AIDS in the country. But we must all remember, for all of its terror and far reach, it is still a disease. It is not vengeance or punishment or just deserts; it is an illness. We have fought illnesses before, and we must fight this one now.', '\tNot so long ago, polio was an awful scourge. When I was a child, parents still lived in terror of their children contracting it. But when President Roosevelt, himself a polio survivor, lent his way to the cause of research and eradication, in a matter of a couple of decades polio was an endangered species. Not so long ago, no one spoke the word ""cancer"" without fear and a good deal of ignorance. I can remember that well. I lost a stepfather to cancer and my mother is a breast cancer survivor. But now it is commonplace for people to welcome home cancer survivors, instead of saying good-bye to cancer casualties. I know personally how that feels.', ""\tAlready AIDS has given us one comfort. It has introduced us to many American heroes and introduced many to the heroes inside themselves--heroes like the people who've worked so hard to extend a helping hand to help people with AIDS even in the early days when it was dark and lonely; who created service organizations and education programs to help people with care and compassion; heroes like my friends Elizabeth Glaser and Bob Hattoy who's here tonight--who spoke with courage before the whole nation at the Democratic convention about being HIV-positive.""]",NA,1992,reject,FALSE,568

But large-scale prevention efforts have been invisible, at least at the national level. We have no model curricula for our schools, no household mailings to follow up on that one courageous effort by Dr. Koop, who was President Reagan's Surgeon General, no nationwide outreach programs like the efforts of the Jersey City Mayor's Task Force here, which has been taking the message to places where real people will hear it.

Seventy million of us have no adequate health insurance and about 37 million have no health insurance at all. Countless Americans fear that a sudden illness or accident will force the choice literally between their money or their lives. Under our heath care system, all Americans will have access to quality and affordable heath care through coverage from their employer, or if they're unemployed, through their government. Our plan will include voluntary, confidential, and anonymous testing and counseling for HIV, as well as the monitoring, therapy and drugs that people who test positive need. And experimental therapies will be more accessible to people with HIV."", '\tThe most important thing we can do to help people is to figure out how to stop it, cure it, and immunize people against it.

Many times the employees don't even know their employers are self-insured. And I recognize how much easier it would be to be humane with employees if we had a national insurance reform which mandated large pools for small businesses, self-employed people, and farmers so they could have access to rates at the same low level that people in big companies have."", ""\tI will fight discrimination in federal programs.

But this means a change away from the Republican party which even in this area pioneered by Theodore Roosevelt, by Pinchot, by Franklin Roosevelt.  The development of our natural resources has been blocked by a policy of no new starts which will be a memorial to the last eight years in the western United States, which is our great natural resources belonging to all the people.  The three Americans who did more to develop the resources of the United States all came from the East.  The two Roosevelts from New York, Pinchot from Pennsylvania.  They are national assets and should be developed for the nation as our population begins to double in the next forty years."", '\tI believe in an America where the free enterprise system flourishes for all other systems to see and admire--where no businessman lacks either competition or credit--and where no monopoly, no racketeer, no government bureaucracy can put him out of business that he built up with his own initiative.', '\tI believe in an America where the rights that I have described are enjoyed by all, regardless of their race or their creed or their national origin--where every citizen is free to think and speak as he pleases and write and worship as he pleases--and where every citizen is free to vote as he pleases, without instructions from anyone, without instructions from anyone--his employer, the union leader or his clergyman.', ""\tFinally I believe in an America with a government of men devoted solely to the public interests--men of ability and dedication, free from conflict or corruption or other commitment--a responsible government that is efficient and economical, with a balanced budget over the years of the cycle, reducing its debt in prosperous times--a government willing to entrust the people with the facts that they have--not a businessman's government, with business in the saddle, as the late Secretary McKay described this administration of which he was a member--not a labor government, not a farmer's government, not a government of one section of the country or another, but a government of, for and by the people."", '\tIn short, I believe in an America that is on the march--an America respected by all nations, friends and foes alike--an America that is moving, doing, working, trying--a strong America in a world of peace.', '\tThat peace must be based on world law and world order, on the mutual respect of all nations for the rights and powers of others and on a world economy in which no nation lacks the ability to provide a decent standard of living for all of its people.  But we cannot have such a world, and we cannot have such a peace, unless the United States has the vitality and the inspiration and the strength.', '\tIf we continue to stand still--if we continue to lie at anchor--if we continue to sit on dead center--if we content ourselves with the easy life and the rosy assurances--then the gates will soon be open to a lean and hungry enemy.', '\tJohn Boyle O\'Reilly years ago once, in a poem, said:  ""The world is large when weary leagues do loving hearts divide.  But the world is small when your enemy is loose on the other side.""  Our enemy is loose on the other side--the world is small--and the best is required of us.  And so I am unable to campaign for the presidency telling you ""you never had it so good"" or telling you that life will be easy and soft in the Great Republic if I\'m successful in this election.', '\tThe kind of America in which we believe lies beyond the new and challenging frontiers on which we now stand.  New crises, new demands, new pressures, new problems, new opportunities must all be met before success can be finally realized.  And they cannot be met by the president by himself; they can be met by a united country moving forward, committed to progress.', '\tSo give me your help, your hand, your voice in the week ahead and remember what the Bible tells us:  ""That whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.""  If in this coming week, and in all the coming weeks and years that follow, we can sow the seeds of dedication and effort, we shall surely reap a great victory for our country and serve importantly and significantly in our time the whole cause of human freedom.']",NA,1960,reject,FALSE,587
