70	@DavidShuster @senjudiciary The Republicans hope to create a faux-judicial arena around Dr. Ford's trauma. They'll use the same \asked for it\ and \how bad could it have been\ tactics that law enforcement has used, and then declare Kavanaugh \innocent\. She's wise to proceed cautiously.	0	70

640	@Dogman1013 In my gut I believe FORD WILL NOT TEASTIFY. There will be a FINAL RUSE by Fords attorney that she will not testify due to a nervous breakdown. OF COURSE THIS WILL BE A PLOY AND FABRICATION TO DERAIL KAVANAUGH FROM APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT	1	640
879	@EWErickson I can see the #resistance having Kavanaugh hauled away in handcuffs as a final act to taint his nomination.	1	879

1099	@EdwardTHardy Good. Because it isn‚Äôt just that he doesn‚Äôt deserve a Supreme Court seat. He doesn‚Äôt deserve a seat on the DC circuit court other, nor an appointment to the bar. In fact, he needs to be prosecuted for perjury and sexual assault and face prison time.	0	1099
3530	@Elizabe32720841 @ChuckGrassley Well, there you go, good for you.  That's what I was looking for! So, don't silence Judge Kavanaugh either then. See how that works?

2447	@GovMikeHuckabee You seem to think that being found guilty in a court of law and losing freedom by going to prison are the same things as being found guilty in the court of public opinion and losing the ability to sit on the Supreme Court. I'm sure Franklin knew the difference.	0	2447
