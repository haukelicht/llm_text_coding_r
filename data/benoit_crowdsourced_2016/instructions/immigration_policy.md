# Coding immigration policy statements in political text

## Summary

This task involves reading sentences from political texts from the 2010 UK general election, and judging whether these statements deal with immigration policy. Each sentence may or may not be related to immigration policy. We tell you below what we mean by “immigration policy”.

First, you will read a short section from a party manifesto. For the sentence highlighted in red, enter your best judgment about whether it refers to some aspect of immigration policy, or not. Most sentences will not relate to immigration policy -- it is your job to find and rate those that do. If the sentence does not refer to immigration policy, you should select "Not immigration policy" and proceed directly to the next sentence. If the sentence does refer to immigration policy, you should indicate this by checking this option.

If you indicate that the sentence is immigration policy, you will be asked to give your best judgment of the policy position on immigration being expressed in the sentence. This will range from a very open and favourable position on immigration, to a very closed and negative stance on immigration. These are coded on a five-point scale, with a neutral position (neither favouring nor opposing) immigration lying in the middle.
