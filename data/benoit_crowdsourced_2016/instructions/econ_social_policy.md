This task involves reading sentences from political texts and judging whether these deal with economic or social policy.

The sentences you will be asked to interpret come from political party manifestos. Some of these sentences will deal with economic policy; some will deal with social policy; other sentences will deal with neither economic nor social policy. We tell you below about what we mean by "economic" and "social" policy.

First, you will read a short section from a party manifesto. For the sentence highlighted in red, enter your best judgment about whether it mainly refers to economic policy, to social policy, or to neither.

If the sentence refers to economic policy, select "economic" in the drop down menu; if it refers to social policy, select "social". If the sentence does not refer to either policy area, select "Not Economic or Social" -- in this case you will move directly to the next sentence.

If you select "economic" or "social", you will be shown a policy scale. Use this to give your best judgment of the sentence in terms of how much it is left or right wing (for economic policy) or liberal or conservative (for social policy). We tell you below about what we mean by "left" and "right" etc..

For example, if you see a sentence containing what you think is very right wing economic policy, select the economic policy area from the drop down menu and click "very right" on the economic policy scale. If you think it has a position that is left-wing, but not very left wing, click "left".

If you believe the sentence expresses a centrist position on economic or social policy OR concerns economic or social policy but does not express any clear position, select the appropriate policy category from the drop down menu, as above, and then click the "neither/nor" position on the scale.

Now we need to tell you about what we mean by "economic" and "social" policy, and by "left" and "right", "liberal" and "conservative".

## What is "economic" policy? What are "left" or "right" economic policies?

**"Economic" policies** deal with all aspects of the economy, including:

- Taxation
- Government spending
- Services provided by the government or other public bodies
- Pensions, unemployment and welfare benefits, and other state benefits
- Property, investment and share ownership, public or private
- Interest rates and exchange rates
- Regulation of economic activity, public or private
- Relations between employers, workers and trade unions

**"Left" economic policies** tend to favor one or more of the following: 

- High levels of services provided by the government and state benefits, even if this implies high levels of taxation;
- Public investment. Public ownership or control of sections of business and industry;
- Public regulation of private business and economic activity;
- Support for workers/trade unions relative to employers


**"Right" economic policies** tend to favor one or more of the following: 

- Low levels of taxation, even if this implies low levels of levels of services provided by the government and state benefits;
- Private investment. Minimal public ownership or control of business and industry;
- Minimal public regulation of private business and economic activity;
- Support for employers relative to trade unions/workers

**"Social" policies** deal with aspects of social and moral life, relationships between social groups, and matters of national and social identity, including:

- Policing, crime, punishment and rehabilitation of offenders;
- Immigration, relations between social groups, discrimination and multiculturalism;
- The role of the state in regulating the social and moral behavior of individuals

**"Liberal" social policies** tend to favor one or more of the following: 
Recording the contents of political text on economic and social scales

- Policies emphasizing prevention of crime, rehabilitation of convicted criminals.
- The right of individuals to make personal moral choices on matters such as abortion, gay rights, and euthanasia;
- Policies penalizing discrimination against particular social groups and/or favoring a multicultural society

**"Conservative" social policies** tend to favor one or more of the following: 

- Policies emphasizing more aggressive policing, increasing police numbers, conviction and punishment of criminals, building more prisons
- The right of society to regulate personal moral choices on matters such as abortion, gay rights, and euthanasia;
- Policies favoring restriction of immigration, and/or opposing explicit provision of state services for minority cultures.

## Text Examples

Below we provide two examples of text from the manifestos and instructions on how they should be coded, and why.

### Example 1: "Right" economic policy:

> With a Conservative Government, all that has been changing. **We were determined to make share-ownership available to the whole nation.** Just as with cars, television sets, washing machines and foreign holidays, it would no longer be a privilege of the few

The highlighted text should be coded as "economic" because it references ownership.  In addition, the text is "right" because it is promoting private ownership.

### Example 2: "Liberal" social policy:

ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON. Every effort should be made to ensure that fine defaulters, elderly shoplifters and drunks are not sent to prison. **Police cautions and intermediate treatment should be more widely used.** Where punishment is appropriate, it should normally be community service rather than prison.

The highlighted text should be coded as having to do with "social" policy because it references policing.  In addition the text is "liberal" because it promotes alternative punitive measures to prison.
